<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>III. Matrimonial Consent</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1625
The parties to a marriage covenant are a baptized man and woman, free to
contract marriage, who freely express their consent; &quot;to be free&quot;
means: <br>
- not being under constraint; <br>
- not impeded by any natural or ecclesiastical law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1626
The Church holds the exchange of consent between the spouses to be the
indispensable element that &quot;makes the marriage.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VE href="__P53.HTM#$1VE">125</a></sup></font> If
consent is lacking there is no marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1627
The consent consists in a &quot;human act by which the partners mutually give
themselves to each other&quot;: &quot;I take you to be my wife&quot; - &quot;I
take you to be my husband.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VF href="__P53.HTM#$1VF">126</a></sup></font> This consent that binds the spouses
to each other finds its fulfillment in the two &quot;becoming one
flesh.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VG href="__P53.HTM#$1VG">127</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1628
The consent must be an act of the will of each of the contracting parties, free
of coercion or grave external fear.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VH href="__P53.HTM#$1VH">128</a></sup></font> No human power can substitute
for this consent.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VI href="__P53.HTM#$1VI">129</a></sup></font> If this freedom is lacking the marriage is
invalid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1629
For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage null and void)
the Church, after an examination of the situation by the competent ecclesiastical
tribunal, can declare the nullity of a marriage, i.e., that the marriage never
existed.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VJ href="__P53.HTM#$1VJ">130</a></sup></font> In this case the contracting parties are free to marry,
provided the natural obligations of a previous union are discharged.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VK href="__P53.HTM#$1VK">131</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1630
The priest (or deacon) who assists at the celebration of a marriage receives
the consent of the spouses in the name of the Church and gives the blessing of
the Church. the presence of the Church's minister (and also of the witnesses)
visibly expresses the fact that marriage is an ecclesial reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1631
This is the reason why the Church normally requires that the faithful contract
marriage according to the ecclesiastical form. Several reasons converge to
explain this requirement:<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VL href="__P53.HTM#$1VL">132</a></sup></font> <br>
- Sacramental marriage is a liturgical act. It is therefore appropriate that it
should be celebrated in the public liturgy of the Church; <br>
- Marriage introduces one into an ecclesial order, and creates rights and
duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children; - Since
marriage is a state of life in the Church, certainty about it is necessary
(hence the obligation to have witnesses); <br>
- the public character of the consent protects the &quot;I do&quot; once given
and helps the spouses remain faithful to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1632
So that the &quot;I do&quot; of the spouses may be a free and responsible act
and so that the marriage covenant may have solid and lasting human and
Christian foundations, preparation for marriage is of prime importance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The example and teaching given by parents and families remain the
special form of this preparation. <br>
The role of pastors and of the Christian community as the &quot;family of
God&quot; is indispensable for the transmission of the human and Christian
values of marriage and family,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VM href="__P53.HTM#$1VM">133</a></sup></font> and much more so in our era when many
young people experience broken homes which no longer sufficiently assure this
initiation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'><br>
It is imperative to give suitable and timely instruction to young people, above
all in the heart of their own families, about the dignity of married love, its
role and its exercise, so that, having learned the value of chastity, they will
be able at a suitable age to engage in honorable courtship and enter upon a
marriage of their own.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VN href="__P53.HTM#$1VN">134</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mixed
marriages and disparity of cult</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1633
In
many countries the situation of a mixed marriage (marriage between a Catholic
and a baptized non-Catholic) often arises. It requires particular attention on
the part of couples and their pastors. A case of marriage with disparity of
cult (between a Catholic and a nonbaptized person) requires even greater
circumspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1634
Difference
of confession between the spouses does not constitute an insurmountable
obstacle for marriage, when they succeed in placing in common what they have
received from their respective communities, and learn from each other the way
in which each lives in fidelity to Christ. But the difficulties of mixed
marriages must not be underestimated. They arise from the fact that the
separation of Christians has not yet been overcome. the spouses risk
experiencing the tragedy of Christian disunity even in the heart of their own
home. Disparity of cult can further aggravate these difficulties. Differences
about faith and the very notion of marriage, but also different religious
mentalities, can become sources of tension in marriage, especially as regards
the education of children. the temptation to religious indifference can then
arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1635
According
to the law in force in the Latin Church, a mixed marriage needs for liceity the
express permission of ecclesiastical authority.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VO href="__P53.HTM#$1VO">135</a></sup></font> In case of disparity
of cult an express dispensation from this impediment is required for the
validity of the marriage.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VP href="__P53.HTM#$1VP">136</a></sup></font> This permission or dispensation
presupposes that both parties know and do not exclude the essential ends and
properties of marriage and the obligations assumed by the Catholic party
concerning the baptism and education of the children in the Catholic
Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VQ href="__P53.HTM#$1VQ">137</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1636
Through
ecumenical dialogue Christian communities in many regions have been able to put
into effect a common pastoral practice for mixed marriages. Its task is to help
such couples live out their particular situation in the light of faith,
overcome the tensions between the couple's obligations to each other and
towards their ecclesial communities, and encourage the flowering of what is
common to them in faith and respect for what separates them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1637
In
marriages with disparity of cult the Catholic spouse has a particular task:
&quot;For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and the
unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VR href="__P53.HTM#$1VR">138</a></sup></font> It is a
great joy for the Christian spouse and for the Church if this
&quot;consecration&quot; should lead to the free conversion of the other spouse
to the Christian faith.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1VS href="__P53.HTM#$1VS">139</a></sup></font> Sincere married love, the humble and patient
practice of the family virtues, and perseverance in prayer can prepare the
non-believing spouse to accept the grace of conversion.</p>
