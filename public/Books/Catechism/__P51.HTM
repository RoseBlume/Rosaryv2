<p class=MsoNormal>1602
Sacred Scripture begins with the creation of man and woman in the image and
likeness of God and concludes with a vision of &quot;the wedding-feast of the
Lamb.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UA href="__P51.HTM#$1UA">85</a></sup></font> Scripture speaks throughout of marriage and its
&quot;mystery,&quot; its institution and the meaning God has given it, its
origin and its end, its various realizations throughout the history of
salvation, the difficulties arising from sin and its renewal &quot;in the Lord&quot;
in the New Covenant of Christ and the Church.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UB href="__P51.HTM#$1UB">86</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marriage in
the order of creation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1603
&quot;The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the married
state has been established by the Creator and endowed by him with its own
proper laws.... God himself is the author of marriage.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UC href="__P51.HTM#$1UC">87</a></sup></font> The
vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and woman as they
came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution
despite the many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in
different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These
differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent
characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent
everywhere with the same clarity,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UD href="__P51.HTM#$1UD">88</a></sup></font> some sense of the greatness of the
matrimonial union exists in all cultures. &quot;The well-being of the
individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely bound up
with the healthy state of conjugal and family life.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UE href="__P51.HTM#$1UE">89</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1604
God who created man out of love also calls him to love the fundamental and
innate vocation of every human being. For man is created in the image and
likeness of God who is himself love.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UF href="__P51.HTM#$1UF">90</a></sup></font> Since God created him man and
woman, their mutual love becomes an image of the absolute and unfailing love
with which God loves man. It is good, very good, in the Creator's eyes. and
this love which God blesses is intended to be fruitful and to be realized in
the common work of watching over creation: &quot;and God blessed them, and God
said to them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue
it.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UG href="__P51.HTM#$1UG">91</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1605
Holy Scripture affirms that man and woman were created for one another:
&quot;It is not good that the man should be alone.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UH href="__P51.HTM#$1UH">92</a></sup></font> The woman,
&quot;flesh of his flesh,&quot; i.e., his counterpart, his equal, his nearest
in all things, is given to him by God as a &quot;helpmate&quot;; she thus
represents God from whom comes our help.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UI href="__P51.HTM#$1UI">93</a></sup></font> &quot;Therefore a man leaves
his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one
flesh.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UJ href="__P51.HTM#$1UJ">94</a></sup></font> The Lord himself shows that this signifies an
unbreakable union of their two lives by recalling what the plan of the Creator
had been &quot;in the beginning&quot;: &quot;So they are no longer two, but one
flesh.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UK href="__P51.HTM#$1UK">95</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marriage
under the regime of sin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1606
Every man experiences evil around him and within himself. This experience makes
itself felt in the relationships between man and woman. Their union has always
been threatened by discord, a spirit of domination, infidelity, jealousy, and
conflicts that can escalate into hatred and separation. This disorder can
manifest itself more or less acutely, and can be more or less overcome
according to the circumstances of cultures, eras, and individuals, but it does
seem to have a universal character.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1607
According to faith the disorder we notice so painfully does not stem from the
nature of man and woman, nor from the nature of their relations, but from sin.
As a break with God, the first sin had for its first consequence the rupture of
the original communion between man and woman. Their relations were distorted by
mutual recriminations;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UL href="__P51.HTM#$1UL">96</a></sup></font> their mutual attraction, the Creator's own
gift, changed into a relationship of domination and lust;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UM href="__P51.HTM#$1UM">97</a></sup></font> and the
beautiful vocation of man and woman to be fruitful, multiply, and subdue the
earth was burdened by the pain of childbirth and the toil of work.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UN href="__P51.HTM#$1UN">98</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1608
Nevertheless, the order of creation persists, though seriously disturbed. To
heal the wounds of sin, man and woman need the help of the grace that God in
his infinite mercy never refuses them.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UO href="__P51.HTM#$1UO">99</a></sup></font> Without his help man and woman
cannot achieve the union of their lives for which God created them &quot;in the
beginning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marriage
under the pedagogy of the Law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1609
In his mercy God has not forsaken sinful man. the punishments consequent upon
sin, &quot;pain in childbearing&quot; and toil &quot;in the sweat of your
brow,&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UP href="__P51.HTM#$1UP">100</a></sup></font> also embody remedies that limit the damaging effects of
sin. After the fall, marriage helps to overcome self-absorption, egoism,
pursuit of one's own pleasure, and to open oneself to the other, to mutual aid
and to self-giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1610
Moral conscience concerning the unity and indissolubility of marriage developed
under the pedagogy of the old law. In the Old Testament the polygamy of
patriarchs and kings is not yet explicitly rejected. Nevertheless, the law
given to Moses aims at protecting the wife from arbitrary domination by the
husband, even though according to the Lord's words it still carries traces of
man's &quot;hardness of heart&quot; which was the reason Moses permitted men to
divorce their wives.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UQ href="__P51.HTM#$1UQ">101</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1611
Seeing God's covenant with Israel in the image of exclusive and faithful
married love, the prophets prepared the Chosen People's conscience for a
deepened understanding of the unity and indissolubility of marriage.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UR href="__P51.HTM#$1UR">102</a></sup></font>
The books of Ruth and Tobit bear moving witness to an elevated sense of
marriage and to the fidelity and tenderness of spouses. Tradition has always
seen in the Song of Solomon a unique expression of human love, a pure
reflection of God's love - a love &quot;strong as death&quot; that &quot;many
waters cannot quench.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1US href="__P51.HTM#$1US">103</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Marriage in
the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1612
The nuptial covenant between God and his people Israel had prepared the way for
the new and everlasting covenant in which the Son of God, by becoming incarnate
and giving his life, has united to himself in a certain way all mankind saved
by him, thus preparing for &quot;the wedding-feast of the
Lamb.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UT href="__P51.HTM#$1UT">104</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1613
On the threshold of his public life Jesus performs his first sign - at his mother's
request - during a wedding feast.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UU href="__P51.HTM#$1UU">105</a></sup></font> The Church attaches great
importance to Jesus' presence at the wedding at Cana. She sees in it the
confirmation of the goodness of marriage and the proclamation that thenceforth
marriage will be an efficacious sign of Christ's presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1614
In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union
of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning permission given
by Moses to divorce one's wife was a concession to the hardness of
hearts.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UV href="__P51.HTM#$1UV">106</a></sup></font> The matrimonial union of man and woman is indissoluble: God
himself has determined it &quot;what therefore God has joined together, let no
man put asunder.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UW href="__P51.HTM#$1UW">107</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1615
This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may
have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize.
However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too
heavy - heavier than the Law of Moses.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UX href="__P51.HTM#$1UX">108</a></sup></font> By coming to restore the
original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and
grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God. It is by
following Christ, renouncing themselves, and taking up their crosses that
spouses will be able to &quot;receive&quot; the original meaning of marriage
and live it with the help of Christ.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UY href="__P51.HTM#$1UY">109</a></sup></font> This grace of Christian
marriage is a fruit of Christ's cross, the source of all Christian life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1616
This is what the Apostle Paul makes clear when he says: &quot;Husbands, love
your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he
might sanctify her,&quot; adding at once: &quot;'For this reason a man shall
leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become
one. This is a great mystery, and I mean in reference to Christ and the
Church.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1UZ href="__P51.HTM#$1UZ">110</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1617
The entire Christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of Christ and the
Church. Already Baptism, the entry into the People of God, is a nuptial
mystery; it is so to speak the nuptial bath<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V0 href="__P51.HTM#$1V0">111</a></sup></font> which precedes the
wedding feast, the Eucharist. Christian marriage in its turn becomes an
efficacious sign, the sacrament of the covenant of Christ and the Church. Since
it signifies and communicates grace, marriage between baptized persons is a
true sacrament of the New Covenant.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V1 href="__P51.HTM#$1V1">112</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Virginity
for the sake of the Kingdom</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1618
Christ is the center of all Christian life. the bond with him takes precedence
over all other bonds, familial or social.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V2 href="__P51.HTM#$1V2">113</a></sup></font> From the very beginning of
the Church there have been men and women who have renounced the great good of
marriage to follow the Lamb wherever he goes, to be intent on the things of the
Lord, to seek to please him, and to go out to meet the Bridegroom who is
coming.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V3 href="__P51.HTM#$1V3">114</a></sup></font> Christ himself has invited certain persons to follow him in
this way of life, of which he remains the model:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>&quot;For there are eunuchs
who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs
by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of
the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive
it.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V4 href="__P51.HTM#$1V4">115</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1619
Virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven is an unfolding of baptismal
grace, a powerful sign of the supremacy of the bond with Christ and of the
ardent expectation of his return, a sign which also recalls that marriage is a
reality of this present age which is passing away.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V5 href="__P51.HTM#$1V5">116</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1620
Both the sacrament of Matrimony and virginity for the Kingdom of God come from
the Lord himself. It is he who gives them meaning and grants them the grace
which is indispensable for living them out in conformity with his
will.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V6 href="__P51.HTM#$1V6">117</a></sup></font> Esteem of virginity for the sake of the kingdom<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V7 href="__P51.HTM#$1V7">118</a></sup></font> and
the Christian understanding of marriage are inseparable, and they reinforce
each other:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Whoever denigrates marriage
also diminishes the glory of virginity. Whoever praises it makes virginity more
admirable and resplendent. What appears good only in comparison with evil would
not be truly good. the most excellent good is something even better than what
is admitted to be good.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-1V8 href="__P51.HTM#$1V8">119</a></sup></font></p>
