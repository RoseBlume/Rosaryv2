<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Paragraph 2. ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE FROM THE
DEAD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>638
&quot;We bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this
day he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SC href="__P1S.HTM#$SC">488</a></sup></font>
The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith in Christ, a faith
believed and lived as the central truth by the first Christian community;
handed on as fundamental by Tradition; established by the documents of the New
Testament; and preached as an essential part of the Paschal mystery along with
the cross:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Christ is risen from the dead!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>Dying, he conquered death;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:35.4pt'>To the dead, he has given
life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SD href="__P1S.HTM#$SD">489</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I. THE
HISTORICAL AND TRANSCENDENT EVENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>639
The mystery of Christ's resurrection is a real event, with manifestations that
were historically verified, as the New Testament bears witness. In about A.D.
56 St. Paul could already write to the Corinthians: &quot;I delivered to you as
of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in
accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, that he was raised on
the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to
Cephas, then to the Twelve. . .&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SE href="__P1S.HTM#$SE">490</a></sup></font> The Apostle speaks here of the
living tradition of the Resurrection which he had learned after his conversion
at the gates of Damascus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SF href="__P1S.HTM#$SF">491</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The empty
tomb</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>640
&quot;Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has
risen.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SG href="__P1S.HTM#$SG">492</a></sup></font> The first element we encounter in the framework of the
Easter events is the empty tomb. In itself it is not a direct proof of
Resurrection; the absence of Christ's body from the tomb could be explained
otherwise.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SH href="__P1S.HTM#$SH">493</a></sup></font> Nonetheless the empty tomb was still an essential sign
for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step toward recognizing the
very fact of the Resurrection. This was the case, first with the holy women,
and then with Peter.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SI href="__P1S.HTM#$SI">494</a></sup></font> The disciple &quot;whom Jesus loved&quot;
affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb and discovered &quot;the linen
cloths lying there&quot;, &quot;he saw and believed&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SJ href="__P1S.HTM#$SJ">495</a></sup></font> This
suggests that he realized from the empty tomb's condition that the absence of
Jesus' body could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply
returned to earthly life as had been the case with Lazarus.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SK href="__P1S.HTM#$SK">496</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The appearances
of the Risen One</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>641
Mary Magdalene and the holy women who came to finish anointing the body of
Jesus, which had been buried in haste because the Sabbath began on the evening
of Good Friday, were the first to encounter the Risen One.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SL href="__P1S.HTM#$SL">497</a></sup></font> Thus the
women were the first messengers of Christ's Resurrection for the apostles
themselves.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SM href="__P1S.HTM#$SM">498</a></sup></font> They were the next to whom Jesus appears: first Peter,
then the Twelve. Peter had been called to strengthen the faith of his brothers,<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SN href="__P1S.HTM#$SN">499</a></sup></font>
and so sees the Risen One before them; it is on the basis of his testimony that
the community exclaims: &quot;The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to
Simon!&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SO href="__P1S.HTM#$SO">500</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>642
Everything that happened during those Paschal days involves each of the
apostles - and Peter in particular - in the building of the new era begun on
Easter morning. As witnesses of the Risen One, they remain the foundation
stones of his Church. the faith of the first community of believers is based on
the witness of concrete men known to the Christians and for the most part still
living among them. Peter and the Twelve are the primary &quot;witnesses to his
Resurrection&quot;, but they are not the only ones - Paul speaks clearly of
more than five hundred persons to whom Jesus appeared on a single occasion and
also of James and of all the apostles.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SP href="__P1S.HTM#$SP">501</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>643
Given
all these testimonies, Christ's Resurrection cannot be interpreted as something
outside the physical order, and it is impossible not to acknowledge it as an
historical fact. It is clear from the facts that the disciples' faith was
drastically put to the test by their master's Passion and death on the cross,
which he had foretold.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SQ href="__P1S.HTM#$SQ">502</a></sup></font> The shock provoked by the Passion was so great
that at least some of the disciples did not at once believe in the news of the
Resurrection. Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical exaltation,
the Gospels present us with disciples demoralized (&quot;looking
sad&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SR href="__P1S.HTM#$SR">503</a></sup></font>) and frightened. For they had not believed the holy women
returning from the tomb and had regarded their words as an &quot;idle
tale&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SS href="__P1S.HTM#$SS">504</a></sup></font> When Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter
evening, &quot;he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart,
because they had not believed those who saw him after he had
risen.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ST href="__P1S.HTM#$ST">505</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>644
Even
when faced with the reality of the risen Jesus the disciples are still
doubtful, so impossible did the thing seem: they thought they were seeing a
ghost. &quot;In their joy they were still disbelieving and still
wondering.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SU href="__P1S.HTM#$SU">506</a></sup></font> Thomas will also experience the test of doubt and
St. Matthew relates that during the risen Lord's last appearance in Galilee
&quot;some doubted.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SV href="__P1S.HTM#$SV">507</a></sup></font> Therefore the hypothesis that the Resurrection
was produced by the apostles' faith (or credulity) will not hold up. On the
contrary their faith in the Resurrection was born, under the action of divine
grace, from their direct experience of the reality of the risen Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The condition of Christ's risen humanity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>645
By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen Jesus establishes direct
contact with his disciples. He invites them in this way to recognize that he is
not a ghost and above all to verify that the risen body in which he appears to
them is the same body that had been tortured and crucified, for it still bears
the traces of his Passion.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SW href="__P1S.HTM#$SW">508</a></sup></font> Yet at the same time this authentic, real
body possesses the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space and
time but able to be present how and when he wills; for Christ's humanity can no
longer be confined to earth, and belongs henceforth only to the Father's divine
realm.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SX href="__P1S.HTM#$SX">509</a></sup></font> For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign
freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gardener or in other forms
familiar to his disciples, precisely to awaken their faith.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SY href="__P1S.HTM#$SY">510</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>646
Christ's Resurrection was not a return to earthly life, as was the case with
the raisings from the dead that he had performed before Easter: Jairus'
daughter, the young man of Naim, Lazarus. These actions were miraculous events,
but the persons miraculously raised returned by Jesus' power to ordinary
earthly life. At some particular moment they would die again. Christ's
Resurrection is essentially different. In his risen body he passes from the
state of death to another life beyond time and space. At Jesus' Resurrection
his body is filled with the power of the Holy Spirit: he shares the divine life
in his glorious state, so that St. Paul can say that Christ is &quot;the man of
heaven&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SZ href="__P1S.HTM#$SZ">511</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Resurrection as transcendent event</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>647
O truly blessed Night, sings the Exsultet of the Easter Vigil, which alone
deserved to know the time and the hour when Christ rose from the realm of the
dead!<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T0 href="__P1S.HTM#$T0">512</a></sup></font> But no one was an eyewitness to Christ's Resurrection and no
evangelist describes it. No one can say how it came about physically. Still
less was its innermost essence, his passing over to another life, perceptible
to the senses. Although the Resurrection was an historical event that could be
verified by the sign of the empty tomb and by the reality of the apostles'
encounters with the risen Christ, still it remains at the very heart of the
mystery of faith as something that transcends and surpasses history. This is
why the risen Christ does not reveal himself to the world, but to his
disciples, &quot;to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who
are now his witnesses to the people.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T1 href="__P1S.HTM#$T1">513</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II. THE
RESURRECTION - A WORK OF THE HOLY TRINITY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>648
Christ's Resurrection is an object of faith in that it is a transcendent
intervention of God himself in creation and history. In it the three divine
persons act together as one, and manifest their own proper characteristics. the
Father's power &quot;raised up&quot; Christ his Son and by doing so perfectly
introduced his Son's humanity, including his body, into the Trinity. Jesus is
conclusively revealed as &quot;Son of God in power according to the Spirit of
holiness by his Resurrection from the dead&quot;.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T2 href="__P1S.HTM#$T2">514</a></sup></font> St. Paul insists
on the manifestation of God's power<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T3 href="__P1S.HTM#$T3">515</a></sup></font> through the working of the
Spirit who gave life to Jesus' dead humanity and called it to the glorious state
of Lordship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>649
As for the Son, he effects his own Resurrection by virtue of his divine power.
Jesus announces that the Son of man will have to suffer much, die, and then
rise.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T4 href="__P1S.HTM#$T4">516</a></sup></font> Elsewhere he affirms explicitly: &quot;I lay down my life, that
I may take it again. . . I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take
it again.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T5 href="__P1S.HTM#$T5">517</a></sup></font> &quot;We believe that Jesus died and rose
again.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T6 href="__P1S.HTM#$T6">518</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>650
The Fathers contemplate the Resurrection from the perspective of the divine
person of Christ who remained united to his soul and body, even when these were
separated from each other by death: &quot;By the unity of the divine nature,
which remains present in each of the two components of man, these are reunited.
For as death is produced by the separation of the human components, so
Resurrection is achieved by the union of the two.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T7 href="__P1S.HTM#$T7">519</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III. THE
MEANING AND SAVING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESURRECTION</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>651
&quot;If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your
faith is in vain.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T8 href="__P1S.HTM#$T8">520</a></sup></font> The Resurrection above all constitutes the
confirmation of all Christ's works and teachings. All truths, even those most
inaccessible to human reason, find their justification if Christ by his
Resurrection has given the definitive proof of his divine authority, which he
had promised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>652
Christ's Resurrection is the fulfilment of the promises both of the Old
Testament and of Jesus himself during his earthly life.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T9 href="__P1S.HTM#$T9">521</a></sup></font> The phrase
&quot;in accordance with the Scriptures&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TA href="__P1S.HTM#$TA">522</a></sup></font> indicates that
Christ's Resurrection fulfilled these predictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>653
The truth of Jesus' divinity is confirmed by his Resurrection. He had said:
&quot;When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am
he.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TB href="__P1S.HTM#$TB">523</a></sup></font> The Resurrection of the crucified one shows that he was
truly &quot;I AM&quot;, the Son of God and God himself. So St. Paul could
declare to the Jews: &quot;What God promised to the fathers, this he has
fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the
second psalm, 'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TC href="__P1S.HTM#$TC">524</a></sup></font>
Christ's Resurrection is closely linked to the Incarnation of God's Son, and is
its fulfilment in accordance with God's eternal plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>654
The Paschal mystery has two aspects: by his death, Christ liberates us from
sin; by his Resurrection, he opens for us the way to a new life. This new life
is above all justification that reinstates us in God's grace, &quot;so that as
Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk
in newness of life.&quot; Justification consists in both victory over the death
caused by sin and a new participation in grace.<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TD href="__P1S.HTM#$TD">526</a></sup></font> It brings about
filial adoption so that men become Christ's brethren, as Jesus himself called
his disciples after his Resurrection: &quot;Go and tell my
brethren.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TE href="__P1S.HTM#$TE">527</a></sup></font> We are brethren not by nature, but by the gift of
grace, because that adoptive filiation gains us a real share in the life of the
only Son, which was fully revealed in his Resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>655
Finally, Christ's Resurrection - and the risen Christ himself is the principle
and source of our future resurrection: &quot;Christ has been raised from the
dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. . . For as in Adam all
die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TF href="__P1S.HTM#$TF">528</a></sup></font> The risen
Christ lives in the hearts of his faithful while they await that fulfilment. In
Christ, Christians &quot;have tasted. . . the powers of the age to
come&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TG href="__P1S.HTM#$TG">529</a></sup></font> and their lives are swept up by Christ into the heart of
divine life, so that they may &quot;live no longer for themselves but for him
who for their sake died and was raised.&quot;<font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TH href="__P1S.HTM#$TH">530</a></sup></font></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IN BRIEF</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>656 Faith in the Resurrection
has as its object an event which as historically attested to by the disciples,
who really encountered the Risen One. At the same time, this event is
mysteriously transcendent insofar as it is the entry of Christ's humanity into
the glory of God.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>657 The empty tomb and the
linen cloths lying there signify in themselves that by God's power Christ's
body had escaped the bonds of death and corruption. They prepared the disciples
to encounter the Risen Lord.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>658 Christ, &quot;the
first-born from the dead&quot; (Col 1:18), is the
principle of our own resurrection, even now by the justification of our souls
(cf Rom 6:4), and one day by the new life he will
impart to our bodies (cf Rom 8:11).</i></p>
