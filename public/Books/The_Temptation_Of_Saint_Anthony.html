<h4> <a id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
<p>It was at some period between 1875 and 1876 that Lafcadio Hearn—still
a "cub" reporter on a daily paper in Cincinnati—began his translation
of Flaubert's "Temptation of St. Anthony." The definitive edition of
the work, over which the author had laboured for thirty years, had
appeared in 1874.</p>
<p>Hearn was, in his early youth, singularly indifferent to the work of
the Englishmen of the Victorian period. Though he knew the English
masterpieces of that epoch, their large, unacademic freedom of manner
awakened no echoes in his spirit. His instinctive taste was for the
exquisite in style: for "that peculiar kneading, heightening, and
recasting" which Matthew Arnold thought necessary for perfection.
Neither did the matter, more than the manner of the Victorians appeal
to him. The circumstances of his life had at so many points set him
out of touch with his fellows that the affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> mockery of
Thackeray's pictures of English society were alien to his interest.
The laughing heartiness of Dickens' studies of the man in the street
hardly touched him. Browning's poignant analyses of souls were too
rudely robust of manner to move him. Before essaying journalism Hearn
had served for a while as an assistant in the Public Library, and
there he had found and fallen under the spell, of the great Frenchman
of the Romantic School of the '30's—that period of rich flowering of
the Gallic genius. Gautier's tales of ancient weirdnesses fired his
imagination. The penetrating subtleties of his verse woke in the boy
the felicitous emotions which the virtuoso knows in handling cameos
and enamellings by hands which have long been dust. So, also, Hugo's
revivals of the passions and terrors of the mediæval world stirred the
young librarian's eager interest. But most of all his spirit leapt
to meet the tremendous drama of the "Temptation." He comprehended at
once its large significance, its great import, and in his enthusiastic
recognition of its value and meaning he set at once about giving it a
language understood of the people of his own tongue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>
<p>Tunison tells of the little shy, shabby, half-blind boy—the long
dull day of police reporting done—labouring at his desk into the
small hours, with the flickering gas jet whistling overhead, and his
myopic eyes bent close to the papers which he covered with beautiful,
almost microscopic characters—escaping thus from the crass, raw world
about him to delicately and painstakingly turn into English stories
of Cleopatra's cruel, fantastic Egyptian Night's Entertainment.
Withdrawing himself to transliterate tales of pallid beautiful vampires
draining the veins of ardent boys: of lovely faded ghosts of great
ladies descending from shadowy tapestries to coquette with romantic
dreamers; or to find an English voice for the tragedy of the soul of
the Alexandrian cenobite.</p>
<p>It was in such dreams and labours that he found refuge from the
environment that was so antipathetic to his tastes, and in his
immersion in the works of these virtuosos of words, in his passionate
search for equivalents of the subtle nuances of their phrases, he
developed his own style. A style full of intricate assonances, of a
texture close woven and iridescent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>
<p>"One of Cleopatra's Night's"—a translation of some of Gautier's tales
of glamour—was issued in 1882, but at "The Temptation of St. Anthony"
the publishers altogether balked. The manuscript could not achieve even
so much as a reading. America had in the '70's just begun to emerge
from that state of provincial propriety in which we were accused of
clothing even our piano legs in pantelettes. The very name of the work
was sufficient to start modest shivers down the spine of all well
regulated purveyors of books. It was largely due to the painters'
conceptions of the nature of the hermit's trials that the story of
Saint Anthony's spiritual struggle aroused instinctive terrors in all
truly modest natures. The painters—who so dearly love to display their
skill in drawing legs and busts—had been wont to push the poor old
saint into the obscure of the background, and fill all the foreground
with ladies of obviously the very lightest character, in garments
still lighter, if possible. What had reputable American citizens to do
with such as these jades? More especially such jades as seen through
a French imagination! That Flaubert had brushed aside the gross and
jejune<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> conceptions of the painters the publishers would not even take
the pains to learn.</p>
<p>It is amusing now to recall the nervous, timid proprieties of those
days. At the time Hearn failed to see the laughable side of it. He was
then too young and earnest, too passionate and too melancholy to have a
sense of its humours.</p>
<p>He had brought his unfinished manuscript from Cincinnati to New
Orleans, and had continued to work upon it in strange lodgings in
gaunt, old half-ruined Creole houses; at the tables of odd little
French cafés, or among the queer dishes in obscure Spanish and Chinese
restaurants. He had snatched minutes for it amidst the reading and
clipping of exchanges in a newspaper office; had toiled drippingly
over it in the liquifying heats of tropic nights; had arisen from the
"inexpungable langours" of yellow fever to complete its last astounding
pages.</p>
<p>I can remember applauding, with ardent youthful sympathy, his tirades
against the stultifying influence of blind puritanism upon American
literature. I recall his scornful mocking at the inconsistency which
complacently accepted the vulgar seduction, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> the theatrical Brocken
revels of Faust, while shrinking piously from Flaubert's grim story of
the soul of man struggling to answer the riddle of the universe. He
had however an almost equal contempt for the author's countrymen, who
received with eager interest and pleasure the deliberate analysis—in
<i>Madame Bovary</i>—of a woman's degradation and ruin, while they yawned
over the amazing history of humanity's tremendous spiritual adventures.
Hearn's own sensitiveness shrank in pain from the cold insight which
uncovered layer by layer the brutal squalour of a woman's moral
disintegration. But he was moved and astounded by the revelation, in
St. Anthony, of the tragedy and pathos of man's long search for some
body of belief or philosophy by which he could explain to himself
the strange great phenomena of life and death, and the inscrutable
cruelties of Nature. The young translator was filled with a sort of
astonished despair at his inability to make others see the book as
he did—not realizing, in his youthful impatience, that the average
mind clings to the concrete, and is puzzled and terrified by outlines
of thought too large for its range of vision; that the commonplace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
intelligence cannot "see the wood for the trees," and becomes confused
and over-weighted when confronted with the huge outlines of so great a
picture as that drawn by Flaubert in his masterpiece.</p>
<p>There were many points of resemblance between Lafcadio Hearn and the
grandson of the French veterinary. A resemblance rather in certain
qualities of the spirit than in social conditions and physical
endowments. Flaubert, born in 1821, was the son of a surgeon. His
father was long connected with the Hôtel Dieu of Rouen, in which the
boy was born, and in which he lived until his eighteenth year, when he
went to Paris to study law. One of the friends of his early Parisian
days describes him as "a young Greek. Tall, supple, and as graceful as
an athlete. He was charming, <i>mais un peu farouche.</i> Quite unconscious
of his physical and mental gifts; very careless of the impression he
produced, and entirely indifferent to formalities. His dress consisted
of a red flannel shirt, trousers of heavy blue cloth, and a scarf of
the same colour drawn tight about his slender waist. His hat was worn
'any how' and often he abandoned it altogether. When I spoke to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span> him of
fame or influence.... he seemed superbly indifferent. He had no desire
for glory or gain.... What was lacking in his nature was an interest in
<i>les choses extérieures, choses utiles.</i>" ...</p>
<p>One who saw him in 1879 found the young Greek athlete—now close upon
sixty, and having in the interval created some of the great classics
of French literature—"a huge man, a tremendous old man. His long,
straggling gray hair was brushed back. His red face was that of a
soldier, or a sheik—divided by drooping white moustaches. A trumpet
was his voice, and he gesticulated freely ... the colour of his eyes a
bit of faded blue sky."</p>
<p>The study of the law did not hold Flaubert long. It was one of those
<i>choses extérieures, choses utiles</i> to which he was so profoundly
indifferent. Paris bored him. He longed for Rouen, and for his little
student chamber. There he had lain upon his bed whole days at a time;
apparently as lazy as a lizard; smoking, dreaming; pondering the large,
inchoate, formless dreams of youth.</p>
<p>In 1845 his father died, and in the following year he lost his sister
Caroline, whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> passionately loved, and for whom he grieved
all his life. He rejoined his mother, and they established themselves
at Croisset, near Rouen, upon a small inherited property. It was an
agreeable house, pleasantly situated in sight of the Seine. Flaubert
nourished with pleasure a local legend that Pascal had once inhabited
the old Croisset homestead, and that the Abbé Prevost had written
<i>Manon Lescaut</i> within its walls. Near the house—now gone—he built
for himself a pavilion to serve as a study, and in this he spent the
greater portion of the following thirty-four years in passionate,
unremitting labour.</p>
<p>He made a voyage to Corsica in his youth; one to Brittany, with Maxime
du Camp, in 1846; and spent some months in Egypt, Palestine, Turkey,
and Greece in 1849. This Oriental experience gave him the most intense
pleasure, and was the germ of <i>Salammbo</i>, and of the <i>Temptation of St.
Anthony.</i> He never repeated it, though he constantly talked of doing
so. He nursed a persistent, but unrealized dream of going as far as
Ceylon, whose ancient name, Taprobana, he was never weary of repeating;
utterance of its melifluous syllables becoming a positive <i>tic</i>
with him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> Despite these yearnings he remained at home. Despite his
full-blooded physique he would take no more exercise than his terrace
afforded, or an occasional swim in the Seine. He smoked incessantly,
and for months at a stretch worked fifteen hours out of the twenty-four
at his desk. Three hundred volumes might be annotated for a page of
facts. He would write twenty pages, and reduce these by exquisite
concisions, by fastidious rejections to three; would search for hours
for the one word that perfectly conveyed the colour of his thought, and
would—as in the case of the <i>Temptation</i>—wait fifteen years for a
sense of satisfaction with a manuscript before allowing it to see the
light. To Maxime du Camp, who urged him to hasten the completion of his
book in order to take advantage of a favourable opportunity, he wrote
angrily:</p>
<p>"Tu me parais avoir à mon endroit un tic ou vice rédhibitoire. Il
ne m'embête pas; n'aie aucune crainte; mon parti est pris là-dessus
depuis long temps. Je te dirai seulement que tous ces mots; <i>se
dépêcher, c'est le moment, place prise, se poser, ...</i> sont pour moi un
vocabulaire vide de sens...."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>
<p>In one of his letters he says that on occasion he worked violently for
eight hours to achieve one page. He endeavoured never to repeat a word
in that page, and tried to force every phrase to respond to a rhythmic
law. Guy do Maupassant, his nephew and pupil, says that to ensure this
rhythm Flaubert "prenait sa feuille de papier, relevait à la hauteur du
regard et, s'appuyant sur un coude, déclaimait, d'une voix mordant et
haute. Il écoutait la rythme de sa prose, s'arrêtait comme pour saisir
une sonorité fuyant, combinait les tons, éloignait les assonances,
disposait les virgules avec conscience, commes les haltes d'un long
chemin." ...</p>
<p>Flaubert said himself, "une phrase est viable quand elle correspond
à toutes les nécessités de respiration. Je sais qu'elle est bonne
lorsqu'elle peut être lu tout haut."</p>
<p>Henry Irving used to say of himself that it was necessary he should
work harder than other actors because nature had dowered him with
flexibility of neither voice nor feature, and Faguet says that Flaubert
was forced to this excessive toil and incessant watchfulness because
he did not write well naturally. Nevertheless Flaubert's work did not
smell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> of the lamp. Whatever shape his ideas may have worn at birth
when full grown they moved with large classic grace and freedom,
simple, sincere, and beautiful in form. François Coppée calls him "the
Beethoven of French prose."</p>
<p>So conscientious a workman, so laborious and self-sacrificing an artist
had a natural attraction for Lafcadio Hearn, who even in boyhood began
to feel his vocation as "a literary monk." The whole tendency of his
tastes prepared him to understand the true importance of Flaubert's
masterpiece, fitted him especially of all living writers to turn that
masterpiece into its true English equivalent. The two men had much in
common. Both were proud and timid. Both had a fundamental indifference
to <i>choses extérieures, choses utiles.</i> Both were realists of the soul.
Actions interested each but slightly; the emotions from which actions
sprung very much. To both stupidity was even more antipathetic than
wickedness, because each realized that nearly all cruelty and vice have
their germ in ignorance and stupidity rather than in innate rascality.
Flaubert declared, with a sort of rage, that "la bêtise entre dans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
mes pores." He might too have been speaking for Hearn when he said
that the grotesque, the strange, and the monstrous had for him an
inexplicable charm. "It corresponds," he says, "to the intimate needs
of my nature—it does not cause me to laugh, but to dream long dreams."
Hearn, however, mixed with this triste interest a quality that Flaubert
seemed almost wholly to lack—a great tenderness for all things humble,
feeble, ugly and helpless. Both from childhood were curious of poignant
sensations, of the sad, the mysterious and the exotic. And for both the
tropics had an irresistible fascination. Flaubert says, in one of his
letters:</p>
<p>"I carry with me the melancholy of the barbaric races, with their
instincts of migration, and their innate distaste of life, which forced
them to quit their homes in order to escape from themselves. They loved
the sun, all those barbarians who came to die in Italy; they had a
frenzied aspiration toward the light, toward the blue skies, toward an
ardent existence.... Think that perhaps I will never see China, will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>never be rocked to sleep by the cadenced footsteps of camels ... will
never see the shine of a tiger's eyes in the forest.... You can treat
all this as little worthy of pity, but I suffer so much when I think of
it ... as of something lamentable and irremediable."</p>
<p>This is the nostalgia for the strange, for the unaccustomed, that all
born wanderers know. Fate arranges it for many of them that their lives
shall be uneventful, passed in dull, provincial narrowness; but behind
these bars the clipped wings of their spirit are always flutteringly
spread for flight. They know not what they seek, what desire drives
them, but a sense of "the great adventure" unachieved keeps them
restless until they die. It is such as these, these <i>voyageurs
empassionés</i>, when condemned by fortune to a static existence—who find
their outlet in mental wanderings amid the unusual, the grotesque,
and the monstrous. Hearn and Flaubert both were at heart nomads,
seekers of the unaccustomed; stretching toward immensities of space
and time, toward the ghostly, the hidden, the unrealized. Like that
wild fantastic <i>Chimera</i> of the "Temptation" each such soul declares
"<i>je cherche des parfums<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> nouveaux, des fleurs plus large, des plaisirs
inéprouvés.</i>"</p>
<p>Flaubert was but twenty-six when the first suggestion of his
masterpiece came to him. For <i>La Tentation de St. Antoine</i>, it is
coming to be understood, is his masterpiece; is one of the greatest
literary achievements of the French mind. <i>Madame Bovary</i> is more
widely famous and popular, but Flaubert himself always deeply resented
this preference, and was always astonished at the comparative
indifference of the world to the "Temptation." He, too, found it
difficult to realize how hardly the average mind is awakened to an
interest in the incorporeal; how surely cosmic generalizations escape
the grasp of the commonplace intelligence.</p>
<p>Wagner waited a lifetime before the world was dragged reluctantly and
resentfully up to a point from which it could discern the superiority
of the tremendous finale of the Götterdämmerung to the Christmas-card
chorus of angels chanting "<i>Âme chaste et pure</i>" to the beatified
Marguerite. The whole prodigious structure of Wagner's dramatic and
musical thought might have remained a mere adumbration in the soul of
one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> German had chance not set a mad genius upon the throne of Bavaria.
The bourgeoisie would—lacking this royal bullying—have continued to
prefer Goethe and Gounod. Flaubert's great work unfortunately failed of
such patronage.</p>
<p>It was in 1845 that an old picture by Breughel, seen at Genoa, first
inspired Flaubert to attempt the story of St. Anthony. He sought
out an engraving of this conception of Peter the Younger (surnamed
"Hell-Breughel" for his fondness for such subjects), hung it on his
walls at Croisset, and after three years of brooding upon it began,
May 24, 1848, <i>La Tentation de St. Antoine.</i> In twelve months he had
finished the first draught of the work, which bulked to 540 pages. It
was laid aside for "Bovary," and a second version of the "Temptation"
was completed in 1856, but this time the manuscript had been reduced
to 193 pages, and the "blazing phrases, the jewelled words, the
turbulence, the comedy, the mysticism" of the first version had been
superseded by a larger, more dramatic conception. In 1872 he made still
a new draught, and by this time it had shrunk to 136 pages. He even
then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> eliminated three chapters, and finally gave to the world in 1874
"this wonderful coloured panorama of philosophy, this Gulliver-like
travelling amid the master ideas of the antique and early Christian
worlds."</p>
<p>Faguet says, "In its primitive and legendary state the temptation
of St. Anthony was nothing more than the story of a recluse tempted
by the Devil through the flesh, by all the artifices at the Devil's
disposal. In the definite thought of Flaubert the temptation of St.
Anthony has become man's soul tempted by all the illusions of human
thought and imagination. St. Anthony to the eyes of the first naive
hagiologists is a second Adam, seduced by woman, who was inspired by
Satan. St. Anthony conceived by Flaubert is a more thoughtful Faust; a
Faust incapable of irony, not a Faust who could play with illusions and
with himself—secretly persuaded that he could withdraw when he chose
to give himself the trouble to do so—rather a Faust who approached,
accosted, caressed all possible forms of universal illusions."</p>
<p>Flaubert's studies for the "Temptation" were tremendous. For nearly
thirty years he touched and retouched, altered, enlarged,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> condensed.
He kneaded into its substance the knowledge, incessantly sought, of
all religions and philosophies; of all the forms man's speculations
had taken in his endless endeavours to explain to himself Life and
Fate; humanity's untiring, passionate effort to find the meaning of its
mysterious origin and purpose, and final destiny. How terrible, how
naive, how fantastic, bloody, grovelling, and outrageous were most of
the solutions accepted, the gigantic panorama of the book startlingly
sets forth. What gory agonies, what mystic exaltations, what dark
cruelties, frenzied abandons, and inhuman self denials have marked
those puzzled gropings for light and truth are revealed as by lightning
flashes in the crowding scenes of the epic. For the Temptation of St.
Anthony is an epic. Not a drama of man's actions, as all previous
epics have been, but a drama of the soul. All its movement is in the
adventure and conflict of the spirit. St. Anthony remains always in
the one place, almost as moveless as a mirror. His vision—clarified
of the sensual and the actual by his fastings and macerations—becomes
like the surface of an unruffled lake. A lake reflecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> the aberrant
forms of thoughts that, like clouds, drift between man and the infinite
depths of knowledge. Clouds of illusion forever changing, melting,
fusing; assuming forms grotesque, monstrous, intolerable; until at
last the writhing mists of speculation and ignorance are drunk up
by the widening light of wisdom and the fogs and phantasms vanish,
leaving his consciousness aware, in poignant ecstasy, of the cloudless
deeps of truth. The temptation of the flesh is but a passing episode.
An eidolon of Sheba's queen offers him luxury, wealth, voluptuous
beauty, power, dainty delights of eye and palate in vain. Man has never
found his most dangerous seductions in the appetites. More lamentable
disintegration has grown from his attempts to pierce beyond the
body's veil. The parched and tortured saint is whirled by vertiginous
visions through cycles of man's straining efforts to know why, whence,
whither. He assists at the rites of Mithira, the prostrations of
serpent-and-devil-worshippers, worshippers of fire, of light, of the
Greeks' deified forces of nature; of the northern enthronement of brute
force and war. He is swept by the soothing breath of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> Quietism, plunges
into every heresy and philosophy, sees the orgies, the flagellations,
the self mutilations, the battles and furies of sects, each convinced
that it has found the answer at last to the Great Question, and
endeavouring to constrain the rest of humanity to accept the answer.
He meets the Sphinx—embodied interrogation—and the Chimera—the
simulacrum of the fantasies of the imagination—dashing madly about the
stolid querist.</p>
<p>Lucifer—spirit of doubt of all dogmatic solutions—mounts with Anthony
into illimitable space. They rise beyond these struggles and furies
into the cold uttermost of the universe; among innumerable worlds;
worlds yet vaguely forming in the womb of time, newly come to birth,
lustily grown to maturity; worlds dying, decaying, crumbling again into
atomic dust. Overcome by the intolerable Vast, Anthony sinks once more
to his cell, and Lucifer, who has shown him the macrocosm, opens to
him the equal immensity of the microcosm. Makes him see the swarming
life that permeates the seas, the earth and atmosphere, the incredible
numerousness of the invisible lives that people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> every drop of water,
every grain of sand, every breath of air. The unity of life dawns upon
him, and his heart, withered by dubiety, melts into joyousness and
peace. As the day dawns in gold he beholds the face of Christ.</p>
<p>Flaubert's Lucifer has no relation to the jejune Devil of man's
early conception of material evil, nor does he resemble Goethe's
Mephistopheles; embodiment of the Eighteenth Century's spirit
of sneering disbeliefs and negation. He is rather our own
tempter—Science. He is the spirit of Knowledge: Nature itself calling
us to look into the immensities and read just our dogmas by this new
and terrible widening of our mental and moral horizons. This last
experience of the Saint reproduces the spiritual experiences of the
modern man; cast loose from his ancient moorings, and yet finding at
last in his new knowledge a truer conception of the brotherhood of all
life in all its forms, and seeing still, in the growing light, the
benignant eyes of God.</p>
<p>It is not remarkable that Flaubert resented the banality, the dull
grossness of the reception of his work, or that Hearn shared his
amazement and bitterness. Even yet the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> world wakes but slowly to the
true character of this masterpiece; this epic wrought with so great
a care and patience, so instinct with genius, dealing perhaps more
profoundly than any other mind has ever done with the Great Adventure
of humanity's eternal search for Truth.</p>

<h5>FRAILTY</h5>
<p>Sunset in the desert. Enfeebled by prolonged fasting, the hermit
finds himself unable to concentrate his mind upon holy things. His
thoughts wonder; memories of youth evoke regrets that his relaxed will
can no longer find strength to suppress,—and, remembrance begetting
remembrance, his fancy leads him upon dangerous ground. He dreams of
his flight from home,—of Ammonaria, his sister's playmate,—of his
misery in the waste,—his visit to Alexandria with the blind monk
Didymus,—the unholy sights of the luxurious city.</p>
<p>Involuntarily he yields to the nervous dissatisfaction growing upon
him. He laments his solitude, his joylessness, his poverty, the
obscurity of his life; grace departs from him; hope burns low within
his heart. Suddenly revolting against his weakness, he seeks refuge
from distraction in the study of the Scriptures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span></p>
<p>Vain effort! An invisible hand turns the leaves, placing perilous
texts before his eyes. He dreams of the Maccabees slaughtering
their enemies, and desires that he might do likewise with the
Arians of Alexandria;—he becomes inspired with admiration of King
Nebuchadnezzar;—he meditates voluptuously upon the visit of Sheba's
queen of Solomon;—discovers a text in the Acts of the Apostles
antagonistic to principles of monkish ascetism,—indulges in reveries
regarding the riches of Biblical kings and holy men. The Tempter comes
to tempt him with evil hallucinations for which the Saint's momentary
frailty has paved the way; and with the Evil One come also</p>
<h5>THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS</h5>
<p>Phantom gold is piled up to excite Covetousness; shadowy banquets
appear to evoke Gluttony. The scene shifts to aid the temptations of
Anger and of Pride....</p>
<p>Anthony finds himself in Alexandria, at the head of a wild army of
monks slaughtering the heretics and the pagans, without mercy for
age or sex. In fantastic obedience to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> course of his fancy while
reading the Scriptures a while before, and like an invisible echo of
his evil thoughts, the scene changes again. Alexandria is transformed
into Constantinople.</p>
<p>Anthony finds himself the honoured of the Emperor. He beholds the
vast circus in all its splendour, the ocean of faces, the tumult of
excitement. Simultaneously he beholds his enemies degraded to the
condition of slaves, toiling in the stables of Constantine. He feels
joy in the degradation of the Fathers of Nicæa. Then all is transformed.</p>
<p>It is no longer the splendour of Constantinople he beholds under the
luminosity of a Greek day; but the prodigious palace of Nebuchadnezzar
by night. He beholds the orgies, the luxuries, the abominations;—and
the spirit of Pride enters triumphantly into him as the spirit of
Nebuchadnezzar....</p>
<p>Awaking as from a dream, he finds himself again before his hermitage.
A vast caravan approaches, halts; and the Queen of Sheba descends to
tempt the Saint with the deadliest of all temptations. Her beauty is
enhanced by oriental splendour of adornment; her converse is a song of
withcraft. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> Saint remains firm.... The Seven Deadly Sins depart
from him.</p>
<h5>THE HERESIARCHS</h5>
<p>But now the tempter assumes a subtler form. Under the guise of a former
disciple of Anthony,—Hilarion,—the demon, while pretending to seek
instruction, endeavours to poison the mind of Anthony with hatred of
the fathers of the church. He repeats all the scandals amassed by
ecclesiastical intriguers, all the calumnies created by malice;—he
cites texts only to foment doubt, and quotes the evangels only to
make confusion. Under the pretext of obtaining mental enlightenment
from the wisest of men, he induces Anthony to enter with him into
a spectral basilica, wherein are assembled all the Heresiarchs of
the third century. The hermit is confounded by the multitude of
tenets,—horrified by the blasphemies and abominations of Elkes,
Corpocrates, Valentinus, Manes, Cerdo,—disgusted by the perversions of
the Paternians, Marcosians, Montanists, Serptians,—bewildered by the
apocryphal Gospels of Eve and of Judas, of the Lord, and of Thomas.</p>
<p>And Hilarion grows taller.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span></p>
<h5>THE MARTYRS</h5>
<p>Anthony finds himself in the dungeons of a vast amphitheatre, among
Christians condemned to the wild beasts. By this hallucination the
tempter would prove to the Saint that martyrdom is not always suffered
for purest motives. Anthony finds the martyrs possessed by bigotry and
insincerity. He sees many compelled to die against their will; many
who would forswear their faith could it avail them aught. He beholds
heretics die for their heterodoxy more nobly than orthodox believers.</p>
<p>And he finds himself transported to the tombs of the martyrs. He
witnesses the meetings of Christian women at the sepulchres. He beholds
the touching ceremonies of prayer, change into orgies,—lamentations
give place to amorous dalliance.</p>
<h5>THE MAGICIANS</h5>
<p>Then the Tempter seeks to shake Anthony's faith in the excellence
and evidence of miracles. He assumes the form of a Hindoo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span> Brahmin,
terminating a life of wondrous holiness by self-cremation;—he appears
as Simon Magus and Helen of Tyre,—as Appollonius of Tyans, greatest of
all thaumaturgists, who claims superiority to Christ. All the marvels
related by Philostratus are embodied in the converse of Apollonius and
Damis.</p>
<h5>THE GODS</h5>
<p>Hilarion reappears taller than ever, growing more gigantic in
proportion to the increasing weakness of the Saint. Standing beside
Anthony he evokes all the deities of the antique world. They defile
before him in a marvellous panorama:—Gods of Egypt and India, Chaldea
and Hellas, Babylon and Ultima Thule,—monstrous and multiform, phallic
and ithyphallic, fantastic or obscene. Some intoxicate by their beauty;
others appall by their foulness. The Buddha recounts the story of his
wondrous life; Venus displays the rounded daintiness of her nudity;
Isis utters awful soliloquy. Lastly the phantom of Jehovah appears, as
the shadow of a god passing away forever.</p>
<p>Suddenly the stature of Hilarion towers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span> the stars; he assumes the
likeness and luminosity of Lucifer; he announces himself as</p>
<h5>SCIENCE</h5>
<p>And Anthony is lifted upon mighty wings and borne away beyond the
world, above the solar system, above the starry arch of the Milky Way.
All future discoveries of Astronomy are revealed to him. He is tempted
by the revelation of innumerable worlds,—by the refutation of all
his previous ideas of the nature of the Universe,—by the enigmas of
infinity,—by all the marvels that conflict with faith. Even in the
night of immensity the demon renews the temptation of reason: Anthony
wavers upon the verge of pantheism.</p>
<h5>LUST AND DEATH</h5>
<p>Anthony abandoned by the spirit of Science comes to himself in the
desert. Then the Tempter returns under a two-fold aspect: as the
Spirit of Lust and the Spirit of Destruction. The latter urges him to
suicide,—the former to indulgence of sense. They inspire him with
strong fancies of palingenesis, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span> the illusion of death, of the
continuity of life. The pantheistic temptation intensified.</p>
<h5>THE MONSTERS</h5>
<p>Anthony in reveries meditates upon the monstrous symbols painted upon
the walls of certain ancient temples. Could he know their meaning
he might learn also something of the secret lien between Matter and
Thought. Forthwith a phantasmagoria of monsters commence to pass before
his eyes:—the Sphinx and the Chimera, the Blemmyes and Astomi, the
Cynocephali and all creatures of mythologie creation. He beholds the
fabulous beings of Oriental imagining,—the abnormities described
by Pliny and Herodotus, the fantasticalities to be later adopted by
heraldry,—the grotesqueries of future medieval illumination made
animate;—the goblinries and foulnesses of superstitious fancy,—the
Witches' Sabbath of abominations.</p>
<h5>METAMORPHOSIS</h5>
<p>The multitude of monsters melts away; the land changes into an Ocean;
the creatures of the briny abysses appear. And the waters in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span> turn
also change; seaweeds are transformed to herbs, forests of coral
give place to forests of trees, polypous life changes to vegetation.
Metals crystallize; frosts effloresce; plants become living things,
inanimate matter takes animate form, monads vibrate, the pantheism of
nature makes itself manifest. Anthony feels a delirious desire to unite
himself with the Spirit of Universal Being....</p>
<p>The vision vanishes. The sun arises. The face of Christ is revealed.
The temptation has passed; Anthony kneels in prayer.</p>

<h4><a id="I"></a>I</h4>
<p><i>It is in the Thebaid at the summit of a mountain, upon a platform,
rounded off into the form of a demilune, and enclosed by huge stones.</i></p>
<p><i>The Hermit's cabin appears in the background. It is built of mud and
reeds, it is flat-roofed and doorless. A pitcher and a loaf of black
bread can be distinguished within also, in the middle of the apartment
a large book resting on a wooden stela; while here and there, fragments
of basketwork, two or three mats, a basket, and a knife lie upon the
ground.</i></p>
<p><i>Some ten paces from the hut, there is a long cross planted in the
soil; and, at the other end of the platform, an aged and twisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
palm tree leans over the abyss; for the sides of the mountain are
perpendicular, and the Nile appears to form a lake at the foot of the
cliff.</i></p>
<p><i>The view to right and left is broken by the barrier of rocks. But
on the desert-side, like a vast succession of sandy beaches, immense
undulations of an ashen-blonde color extend one behind the other,
rising higher as they recede; and far in the distance, beyond the
sands, the Libyan chain forms a chalk-colored wall, lightly shaded by
violet mists. On the opposite side the sun is sinking. In the north the
sky is of a pearl-gray tint, while at the zenith purple clouds disposed
like the tufts of a gigantic mane, lengthen themselves against the blue
vault. These streaks of flame take darker tones; the azure spots turn
to a nacreous pallor; the shrubs, the pebbles, the earth, all now seem
hard as bronze; and throughout space there floats a golden dust so fine
as to become confounded with the vibrations of the light.</i></p>
<p><i>Saint Anthony, who has a long beard, long hair, and wears a tunic of
goatskin, is seated on the ground cross-legged, and is occupied in
weaving mats. As soon as the sun disappears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> he utters a deep sigh,
and, gazing upon the horizon, exclaims</i>:—</p>
<p>"Another day! another day gone! Nevertheless formerly I used not to
be so wretched. Before the end of the night I commenced my orisons;
then I descended to the river to get water, and remounted the rugged
pathway with the skin upon my shoulder, singing hymns on the way. Then
I would amuse myself by arranging everything in my hut. I would make my
tools; I tried to make all my mats exactly equal in size, and all my
baskets light; for then my least actions seemed to me duties in nowise
difficult or painful of accomplishment.</p>
<p>"Then at regular hours I ceased working; and when I prayed with my arms
extended, I felt as though a fountain of mercy were pouring from the
height of heaven into my heart. That fountain is now dried up. Why?"</p>
<p>(<i>He walks up and down slowly, within the circuit of the rocks.</i>)</p>
<p>"All blamed me when I left the house. My mother sank to the ground,
dying; my sister from afar off made signs to me to return; and the
other—wept, Ammonaria, the child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> whom I used to meet every evening
at the cistern, when she took the oxen to drink. She ran after me. Her
foot rings glittered in the dust; and her tunic, open at the hips,
fluttered loosely in the wind. The aged anchorite who was leading me
away called her vile names. Our two camels galloped forward without
respite; and I have seen none of my people since that day.</p>
<p>"At first, I selected for my dwelling place, the tomb of a Pharaoh. But
an enchantment circulates through all those subterranean palaces, where
the darkness seems to have been thickened by the ancient smoke of the
aromatics. From the depths of Sarcophagi, I heard doleful voices arise,
and call my name; or else, I suddenly beheld the abominable things
painted upon the walls live and move; and I fled away to the shore
of the Red Sea, and took refuge in a ruined citadel. There my only
companions were the scorpions dragging themselves among the stones, and
the eagles continually wheeling above my head, in the blue of heaven.
At night I was torn by claws, bitten by beaks; soft wings brushed
against me; and frightful demons, shrieking in my ears, flung me upon
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> ground. Once I was even rescued by the people of a caravan going
to Alexandria; and they took me away with them.</p>
<p>"Then I sought to obtain instruction from the good old man Didymus.
Although blind, none equalled him in the knowledge of the Scriptures.
When the lesson was finished, he used to ask me to give him my arm
to lean upon, that we might walk together. Then I would conduct him
to the Paneum, whence may be seen the Pharos and the open sea. Then
we would return by way of the post, elbowing men of all nations,
even Cimmerians clad in the skins of bears and Gymnosophists of the
Ganges anointed with cow-dung. But there was always some fighting in
the streets—either on account of the Jews refusing to pay taxes, or
of seditious people who wished to drive the Romans from the city.
Moreover, the city is full of heretics—followers of Manes; Valentinus,
Basilides, Arius—all seeking to engross my attention in order to argue
with me and to convince me.</p>
<p>"Their discourses often come back to my memory. Vainly do I seek to
banish them from my mind. They trouble me!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>"I took refuge at Colzin, and there lived a life of such penance that
I ceased to fear God. A few men, desirous of becoming anchorites,
gathered about me. I imposed a practical rule of life upon them,
hating, as I did, the extravagance of Gnosus and the assertions of the
philosophers. Messages were sent to me from all parts, and men came
from afar off to visit me.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile the people were torturing the confessors; and the thirst of
martyrdom drew me to Alexandria. The persecution had ceased three days
before I arrived there!</p>
<p>"While returning thence, I was stopped by a great crowd assembled
before the temple of Serapis. They told me it was a last example which
the Governor had resolved to make. In the centre of the portico, under
the sunlight, a naked woman was fettered to a column, and two soldiers
were flogging her with thongs; at every blow her whole body writhed.
She turned round, her mouth open; and over the heads of the crowd,
through the long hair half hiding her face, I thought that I could
recognize Ammonaria....</p>

<p class="p2">"Nevertheless ... this one was taller ... and beautiful ...
prodigiously beautiful!"</p>
<p>(<i>He passes his hands over his forehead.</i>)</p>
<p>"No! no! I must not think of it!</p>
<p>"Another time Athanasius summoned me to assist him against the Arians.
The contest was limited to invectives and laughter. But since that
time he has been calumniated, dispossessed of his see, obliged to fly
for safety elsewhere. Where is he now? I do not know! The people give
themselves very little trouble to bring me news. All my disciples have
abandoned me—Hilarion like the rest.</p>
<p>"He was perhaps fifteen years of age when he first came to me and his
intelligence was so remarkable that he asked me questions incessantly.
Then he used to listen to me with a pensive air, and whatever I needed
he brought it to me without a murmur—nimbler than a kid, merry enough
to make even the patriarchs laugh. He was a son to me."</p>
<p>(<i>The sky is red; the earth completely black. Long drifts of sand
follow the course of the gusts of wind, rising like great shrouds and
falling again. Suddenly against a bright space in the sky a flock of
birds pass, forming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> a triangular battalion, gleaming like one sheet of
metal, of which the edges alone seem to quiver.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony watches them.</i>)</p>
<p>"Ah, how I should like to follow them.</p>
<p>"How often also have I enviously gazed upon those long vessels,
whose sails resemble wings—and above all when they were bearing
far away those I had received at my hermitage! What pleasant hours
we passed!—what out-pourings of feeling! No one ever interested me
more than Ammon: he told me of his voyage to Rome, of the Catacombs,
the Coliseum, the piety of illustrious women, and a thousand other
things!—and it grieved me to part with him! Wherefore my obstinacy
in continuing to live such a life as this? I would have done well to
remain with the monks of Nitria, inasmuch as they supplicated me to
do so. They have cells apart, and nevertheless communicate with each
other. On Sundays a trumpet summons them to assemble at the church,
where one may see three scourges hanging up, which serve to punish
delinquents, robbers, and intruders; for their discipline is severe.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless they are not without some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> enjoyments. The faithful bring
them eggs, fruits, and even instruments with which they can extract
thorns from their feet. There are vineyards about Prisperi; those
dwelling at Pabena have a raft on which they may journey when they go
to seek provisions.</p>
<p>"But I might have served my brethren better as a simple priest. As a
priest one may aid the poor, administer the sacraments, and exercise
authority over families.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, all laics are not necessarily damned, and it only
depended upon my own choice to become—for example—a grammarian, a
philosopher. I would then have had in my chamber a sphere of reeds,
and tablets always ready at hand, young men around me, and a wreath of
laurel suspended above my door, as a sign.</p>
<p>"But there is too much pride in triumphs such as those. A soldier's
life would have been preferable. I was robust and bold: bold enough to
fasten the cables of the military machines—to traverse dark forests,
or to enter, armed and helmeted, into smoking cities.... Neither was
there anything to have prevented me from purchasing with my money the
position of publican at the toll-office<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> of some bridge; and travellers
would have taught me many strange things, and told me strange stories,
the while showing me many curious objects packed up among their
baggage....</p>
<p>"The merchants of Alexandria sail upon the river Canopus on holidays,
and drink wine in the chalices of lotus-flowers, to a music of
tambourines which makes the taverns along the shore tremble! Beyond,
trees, made cone-shaped by pruning, protect the quiet farms against
the wind of the south. The roof of the lofty house leans upon thin
colonettes placed as closely together as the laths of a lattice;
and through their interspaces the master, reclining upon his long
couch, beholds his plains stretching about him—the hunter among the
wheat-fields—the winepress where the vintage is being converted into
wine, the oxen treading out the wheat. His children play upon the floor
around him; his wife bends down to kiss him."</p>
<p>(<i>Against the grey dimness of the twilight, here and there appear
pointed muzzles, with straight, pointed ears and bright eyes. Anthony
advances toward them. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> sound of gravel crumbling down; the
animals take flight. It was a troop of jackals.</i></p>
<p><i>One still remains, rising upon his hinder legs, with his body half
arched and head raised in an attitude full of defiance.</i>)</p>
<p>"How pretty he is! I would like to stroke his back gently!"</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony whistles to coax him to approach. The jackal disappears.</i>)</p>
<p>"Ah! he is off to join the others. What solitude! what weariness!"
(<i>Laughing bitterly.</i>)</p>
<p>"A happy life this indeed!—bending palm-branches in the fire to make
shepherds' crooks, fashioning baskets, stitching mats together—and
then exchanging these things with the Nomads for bread which breaks
one's teeth! Ah! woe, woe is me! will this never end? Surely death were
preferable! I can endure it no more! Enough! enough!"</p>
<p>(<i>He stamps his foot upon the ground, and rushes frantically to and fro
among the rocks; then pauses, out of breath, bursts into tears, and
lies down upon the ground, on his side.</i></p>
<p><i>The night is calm; multitudes of stars are palpitating; only the
crackling noise made by the tarantulas is audible.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The two arms of the cross make a shadow upon the sand; Anthony, who is
weeping, observes it.</i>)</p>
<p>"Am I, then, so weak, O my God! Courage, let me rise from here!"</p>
<p>(<i>He enters his hut, turns over a pile of cinders, finds a live ember,
lights his torch and fixes it upon the wooden desk, so as to throw a
light upon the great book.</i>)</p>
<p>"Suppose I take the Acts of the Apostles?—yes!—no matter where!"</p>
<p><i>'And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it
were a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven to
the earth—wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping
things of the earth and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to
him: Arise, Peter! Kill and eat!'</i><a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>"Then the Lord desired that his apostle should eat of all things?...
while I...."</p>

rustling of the pages, agitated by the wind, causes him to lift his
head again; and he reads</i>:)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p><i>'So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies with the sword,
and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to
them....</i><a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>"Then, comes the number of people slain by them—seventy-five thousand.
They had suffered so much! Moreover, their enemies were the enemies of
the true God. And how they must have delighted in avenging themselves
thus by the massacre of idolaters! Doubtless the city must have been
crammed with the dead! There must have been corpses at the thresholds
of the garden gates, upon the stairways, in all the chambers, and piled
up so high that the doors could no longer move upon their hinges!...
But lo! here I am permitting my mind to dwell upon ideas of murder and
of blood!..."</p>
<p>(<i>He opens the book at another place.</i>)</p>
<p><i>'Then King Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped
Daniel....</i>'<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>"Ah! that was just! The <i>Most High</i> exalts his prophets above Kings;
yet that monarch spent his life in banqueting, perpetually drunk with
pleasure and pride. But God, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> punish him, changed him into a beast!
He walked upon four feet!"</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony begins to laugh; and in extending his arms, involuntarily
disarranges the leaves of the book with the tips of his fingers. His
eyes fell upon this phrase</i>:—)</p>
<p><i>'And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he showed them the house
of his aromatical spices, and the gold and the silver, and divers
precious odours and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all
that he had in his treasures....'</i><a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>"I can imagine that spectacle; they must have beheld precious stones,
diamonds and darics heaped up to the very roof. One who possesses so
vast an accumulation of wealth is no longer like other men. While
handling his riches he knows that he controls the total result of
innumerable human efforts—as it were the life of nations drained by
him and stored up, which he can pour forth at will. It is a commendable
precaution on the part of Kings. Even the <i>Wisest</i> of all did not
neglect it. His navy brought him elephants' teeth and apes.... Where is
that passage?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>He turns the leaves over rapidly.</i>)</p>
<p>"Ah! here it is:"</p>
<p><i>'And the Queen of Saba, having heard of the fame of Solomon in the
name of the Lord, came to try him with hard questions.'</i><a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>"How did she hope to tempt him? The <i>Devil</i> indeed sought to tempt
Jesus! But Jesus triumphed because he was God; and Solomon, perhaps,
owing this knowledge of magic! It is sublime—that science! For the
world—as a philosopher once explained it to me, forms a whole, of
which all parts mutually influence one another, like the organs of one
body. It is science which enables us to know the natural loves and
natural repulsions of all things, and to play upon them?... Therefore,
it is really possible to modify what appears to be the immutable order
of the universe?"</p>

why should <i>He</i> come? Besides, do I not know all his artifices? I
repulsed the monstrous anchorite who laughingly offered me little
loaves of warm, fresh bread, the centaur who sought to carry me away
upon his croup, and that black child who appeared to me in the midst of
the sands, who was very beautiful, and who told me that he was called
the Spirit of Lust!"</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony rises and walks rapidly up and down, first to the right, then
to the left.</i>)</p>
<p>"It was by my order that this multitude of holy retreats was
constructed—full of monks all wearing sackcloth of camel's hair
beneath their garments of goatskin, and numerous enough to form an
army. I have cured the sick from afar off; I have cast out demons;
I have passed the river in the midst of crocodiles;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> the Emperor
Constantine wrote me throe letters; Balacius, who had spat upon mine,
was torn to pieces by his own horses; when I reappeared the people of
Alexandria fought for the pleasure of seeing me, and Athanasius himself
escorted me on the way back. But what works have I not accomplished
Lo! for these thirty years and more I have been dwelling and groaning
unceasingly in the desert! Like Eusebius, I have carried thirty-eight
pounds of bronze upon my loins; like Macarius, I have exposed my body
to the stings of insects; like Pacomus, I have passed fifty-three
nights without closing my eyes; and those who are decapitated, tortured
with red hot pincers, or burned alive, are perhaps less meritorious
than I, seeing that my whole life is but one prolonged martyrdom."
(<i>Anthony slackens his pace.</i>)</p>
<p>"Assuredly there is no human being in a condition of such unutterable
misery! Charitable hearts are becoming scarcer. I no longer receive
aught from any one. My mantle is worn out. I have no sandals—I have
not even a porringer!—for I have distributed all I possessed to the
poor and to my family, without retaining so much as one obolus. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
surely I ought to have a little money to obtain the tools indispensable
to my work? Oh, not much! a very small sum.... I would be very saving
of it....</p>
<p>"The fathers of Nicæa, clad in purple robes, sat like magi, upon
thrones ranged along the walls; and they were entertained at a great
banquet and overwhelmed with honours, especially Paphnutius, because he
is one-eyed and lame, since the persecution of Diocletian! The Emperor
kissed his blind eye several times; what foolishness! Besides, there
were such infamous men members of that Council! A bishop of Scythia,
Theophilus! another of Persia, John! a keeper of beasts, Spiridion!
Alexander was too old. Athanasius ought to have shown more gentleness
towards the Arians, so as to have obtained concessions from them.</p>
<p>"Yet would they have made any? They would not hear me! The one who
spoke against me—a tall young man with a curly beard—uttered the
most captious objections to my argument; and while I was seeking words
to express my views they all stared at me with their wicked faces,
and barked like hyenas. Ah! why cannot I have them all exiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> by the
Emperor! or rather have them beaten, crushed, and see them suffer! I
suffer enough myself."</p>
<p>(<i>He leans against his cabin in a fainting condition.</i>)</p>
<p>"It is because I have fasted too long; my strength is leaving me. If I
could eat—only once more—a piece of meat." (<i>He half closes his eyes
with languor.</i>)</p>
<p>"Ah! some red flesh—a bunch of grapes to bite into ... curdled milk
that trembles on a plate!...</p>
<p>"But what has come upon me? What is the matter with me? I feel my heart
enlarging like the sea, when it swells before the storm. An unspeakable
feebleness weighs down upon me, and the warm air seems to waft me
the perfume of a woman's hair. No woman has approached this place;
nevertheless?—"</p>
<p>(<i>He gazes toward the little pathway between the rocks.</i>)</p>
<p>"That is the path by which they come, rocked in their litters by the
black arms of the eunuchs. They descend and joining their hands,
heavy with rings, kneel down before me. They relate to me all their
troubles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> The desire of human pleasure tortures them; they would
gladly die; they have seen in their dreams God calling to them ... and
all the while the hems of their robes fall upon my feet. I repel them
from me. 'Ah! no!' they cry, 'not yet! What shall I do?' They gladly
accept any penitence I impose on them. They ask for the hardest of all;
they beg to share mine and to live with me.</p>
<p>"It is now a long time since I have seen any of them! Perhaps some of
them will come! why not? If I could only hear again, all of a sudden,
the tinkling of mule-bells among the mountains. It seems to me...."</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony clambers upon a rock at the entrance of the pathway, and
leans over, darting his eyes into the darkness.</i>)</p>
<p>"Yes! over there, far off I see a mass moving, like a band of
travellers seeking the way. <i>She</i> is there!... They are making a
mistake." (<i>Calling.</i>)</p>
<p>"This way! Come! Come!"</p>
<p>(<i>Echo repeats: Come! Come! he lets his arms fall, stupefied.</i>)</p>
<p>"What shame for me! Alas! poor Anthony."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>And all of a sudden he hears a whisper:—"Poor Anthony"!</i>)</p>
<p>"Who is there? Speak!"</p>
<p>(<i>The wind passing through the intervals between the rocks, makes
modulations; and in those confused sonorities he distinguishes Voices,
as though the air itself were speaking. They are low, insinuating,
hissing.</i>)</p>
<p><i>The First</i>: "Dost thou desire women?"</p>
<p><i>The Second</i>: "Great heaps of money, rather!"</p>
<p><i>The Third</i>: "A glittering sword?" (<i>and</i>)</p>
<p><i>The Others</i>: "All the people admire thee! Sleep!"</p>
<p>"Thou shalt slay them all, aye, thou shalt slay them!"</p>
<p>(<i>At the same moment objects become transformed. At the edge of the
cliff, the old palm tree with its tuft of yellow leaves, changes into
the torso of a woman leaning over the abyss, her long hair waving in
the wind.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony turns toward his cabin; and the stool supporting the great book
whose pages are covered with black letters, seems to him changed into a
bush all covered with nightingales.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>"It must be the torch which is making this strange play of light....
Let us put it out!"</p>
<p>(<i>He extinguishes it; the obscurity becomes deeper, the darkness
profound.</i></p>
<p><i>And suddenly in the air above there appear and disappear
successively—first, a stretch of water; then the figure of a
prostitute; the corner of a temple, a soldier; a chariot with two white
horses, prancing.</i></p>
<p><i>These images appear suddenly, as in flashes—outlined against the
background of the night, like scarlet paintings executed upon ebony.</i></p>
<p><i>Their motion accelerates. They defile by with vertiginous rapidity.
Sometimes again, they pause and gradually pale and melt away; or else
float off out of sight, to be immediately succeeded by others.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony closes his eyelids.</i></p>
<p><i>They multiply, surround him, besiege him. An unspeakable fear takes
possession of him; and he feels nothing more of living sensation, save
a burning contraction of the epigastrium. In spite of the tumult in
his brain, he is aware of an enormous silence which separates him from
the world. He tries to speak;—impossible!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> He feels as though all the
bands of his life were breaking and dissolving;—and, no longer able to
resist, Anthony falls prostrate upon his mat.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Then a great shadow, subtler than any natural shadow, and festooned
by other shadows along its edges, defines itself upon the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the Devil, leaning upon the roof of the hut, and bearing beneath
his wings—like some gigantic bat suckling its little ones—the Seven
Deadly Sins, whose grimacing heads are dimly distinguishable.</i></p>
<p><i>With eyes still closed, Anthony yields to the pleasure of inaction;
and stretches his limbs upon the mat.</i></p>
<p><i>It seems to him quite soft, and yet softer—so that it becomes as if
padded; it rises up; it becomes a bed. The bed becomes a shallop; water
laps against its sides.</i></p>
<p><i>To right and left rise two long tongues of land, overlooking low
cultivated plains, with a sycamore tree here and there. In the distance
there is a tinkling of bells, a sound of drums and of singers. It is a
party going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> Canopus to sleep upon the temple of Serapis, in order
to have dreams. Anthony knows this; and impelled by the wind, his boat
glides along between the banks. Papyrus-leaves and the red flowers of
the nymphæa, larger than the body of a man, bend over him. He is lying
at the bottom of the boat; one oar at the stem, drags in the water.
From time to time, a lukewarm wind blows; and the slender reeds rub one
against the other, and rustle. Then the sobbing of the wavelets becomes
indistinct. A heavy drowsiness falls upon him. He dreams that he is a
Solitary of Egypt.</i></p>
<p><i>Then he awakes with a start.</i>)</p>
<p>"Did I dream? It was all so vivid that I can scarcely believe I was
dreaming! My tongue burns. I am thirsty."</p>
<p>(<i>He enters the cabin, and gropes at random in the dark.</i>)</p>
<p>"The ground is wet; can it have been raining? What can this mean! My
pitcher is broken into atoms! But the goatskin?" (<i>He finds it.</i>)</p>
<p>"Empty!—completely empty! In order to get down to the river, I should
have to walk for at least three hours; and the night is so dark that I
could not see my way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is a gnawing in my entrails. Where is the bread!"</p>
<p>(<i>After long searching, he picks up a crust not so large as an egg.</i>)</p>
<p>"What? Have the jackals taken it? Ah! malediction!"</p>
<p>(<i>And he flings the bread upon the ground with fury.</i></p>
<p><i>No sooner has the action occurred than a table makes its appearance,
covered with all things that are good to eat.</i></p>
<p><i>The byssus cloth, striated like the bandelets of the sphinx, produces
of itself luminous undulations. Upon it are enormous quarters of red
meats; huge fish; birds cooked in their plumage, and quadrupeds in
their skins; fruits with colors and tints almost human in appearance;
while fragments of cooling ice, and flagons of violet crystal reflect
each other's glittering. Anthony notices in the middle of the table
a boar smoking at every pore—with legs doubled up under its belly,
and eyes half closed—and the idea of being able to eat so formidable
an animal greatly delights him. Then many things appear which he has
never seen before—black hashes, jellies, the color of gold, ragouts in
which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> mushrooms float like nenuphars upon ponds, dishes of whipt cream
light as clouds.</i></p>
<p><i>And the aroma of all this comes to him together with the salt smell of
the ocean, the coolness of mountains, the great perfumes of the woods.
He dilates his nostrils to their fullest extent; his mouth waters; he
thinks to himself that he has enough before him for a year, for ten
years, for his whole life!</i></p>
<p><i>As he gazes with widely-opened eyes at all these viands, others
appear; they accumulate, forming a pyramid crumbling at all its angles.
The wines begin to flow over—the fish palpitate—the blood seethes in
the dishes—the pulp of the fruit protrudes like amorous lips—and the
table rises as high as his breast, up to his very chin at last—now
bearing only one plate and a single loaf of bread, placed exactly in
front of him.</i></p>
<p><i>He extends his hand to seize the loaf. Other loaves immediately
present themselves to his grasp.</i>)</p>
<p>"For me!... all these! But ..." (<i>Anthony suddenly draws back.</i>)</p>
<p>"Instead of one which was there, lo! there are many! It must be a
miracle, then, the same as our Lord wrought!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yet for what purpose?... Ah! all the rest of these things are equally
incomprehensible! Demon, begone from me! depart! begone!"</p>
<p>(<i>He kicks the table from him. It disappears.</i>)</p>
<p>"Nothing more?—no!" (<i>He draws a lung breath.</i>)</p>
<p>"Ah! the temptation was strong! But how well I delivered myself from
it!"</p>
<p>(<i>He lifts his head, and at the same time stumbles over some sonorous
object.</i>)</p>
<p>"Why! what can that be?" (<i>Anthony stoops down.</i>)</p>
<p>"How! a cup! Some traveller must have lost it here. There is nothing
extraordinary...."</p>
<p>(<i>He wets his finger, and rubs.</i>)</p>
<p>"It glitters!—metal! Still, I cannot see very clearly...."</p>
<p>(<i>He lights his torch, and examines the cup.</i>)</p>
<p>"It is silver, ornamented with ovules about the rim, with a medal at
the bottom of it."</p>
<p>(<i>He detaches the medal with his nail!</i>)</p>
<p>"It is a piece of money worth about seven or eight drachmas—not more!
It matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> not! even with that I could easily buy myself a sheepskin."</p>
<p>(<i>A sudden flash of the torch lights up the cup.</i>)</p>
<p>"Impossible! gold? Yes, all gold, solid gold!"</p>
<p>(<i>A still larger piece of money appears at the bottom. Under it he
perceives several others.</i>)</p>
<p>"Why, this is a sum ... large enough to purchase three oxen ... and a
little field!"</p>
<p>(<i>The cup is now filled with pieces of gold.</i>)</p>
<p>"What! what!... a hundred slaves, soldiers, a host ... enough to
buy...."</p>
<p>(<i>The granulations of the rim, detaching themselves form a necklace of
pearls.</i>)</p>
<p>"With such a marvel of jewelry as that, one could win even the wife of
the Emperor!"</p>
<p>(<i>By a sudden jerk, Anthony makes the necklace slip down over his
wrist. He holds the cup in his left hand, and with his right lifts
up the torch so as to throw the light upon it. As water streams
overflowing from the basin of a fountain, so diamonds, carbuncles, and
sapphires, all mingled with broad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> pieces of gold bearing the effigies
of Kings, overflow from the cup in never ceasing streams, to form a
glittering hillock upon the sand.</i>)</p>
<p>"What! how! Staters, cycles, dariacs, aryandics; Alexander, Demetrius,
the Ptolemies, Cæsar!—yet not one of them all possessed so much!
Nothing is now impossible! no more suffering for me! how these
gleams dazzle my eyes! Ah! my heart overflows! how delightful it is!
yes—yes!—more yet! never could there be enough! Vainly I might
continually fling it into the sea, there would always be plenty
remaining for me. Why should I lose any of it? I will keep all, and say
nothing to any one about it; I will have a chamber hollowed out for me
in the rock, and lined with plates of bronze, and I will come here from
time to time to feel the gold sinking down under the weight of my heel;
I will plunge my arms into it as into sacks of grain! I will rub my
face with it, I will lie down upon it!"</p>
<p>(<i>He flings down the torch in order to embrace the glittering heap, and
falls flat upon the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>He rises to his feet. The place is wholly empty.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>"What have I done!</p>
<p>"Had I died during those moments, I should have gone to hell—to
irrevocable damnation."</p>
<p>(<i>He trembles in every limb.</i>)</p>
<p>"Am I, then, accursed? Ah! no; it is my own fault! I allow myself
to be caught in every snare! No man could be more imbecile, more
infamous! I should like to beat myself, or rather to tear myself out
of my own body! I have restrained myself too long. I feel the want of
vengeance—the necessity of striking, of killing!—as though I had a
pack of wild beasts within me! Would that I could hew my way with an
axe, through the midst of a multitude.... Ah, a poniard!..."</p>
<p>(<i>He perceives his knife, and rushes to seize it. The knife slips from
his hand; and Anthony remains leaning against the wall of his hut, with
wide-open mouth, motionless, cataleptic.</i></p>
<p><i>Everything about him has disappeared.</i></p>
<p><i>He thinks himself at Alexandria, upon the Paneum—an artificial
mountain in the centre of the city, encircled by a winding stairway.</i></p>
<p><i>Before him lies Lake Mareolis; on his right hand is the sea, on his
left the country; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> immediately beneath him a vast confusion of
flat roofs, traversed from north to south and from east to west by
two streets which intercross, and which offer throughout their entire
length the spectacle of files of porticoes with Corinthian columns. The
houses overhanging this double colonnade have windows of stained glass.
Some of them support exteriorly enormous wooden cages, into which the
fresh air rushes from without.</i></p>
<p><i>Monuments of various architecture tower up in close proximity.
Egyptian pylons dominate Greek temples. Obelisks appear like lances
above battlements of red brick. In the middle of public squares there
are figures of Hermes with pointed ears, and of Anubis with the head of
a dog. Anthony can distinguish the mosaic pavements of the courtyards,
and tapestries suspended from the beams of ceilings.</i></p>
<p><i>He beholds at one glance, the two ports (the Great Port and the
Eunostus), both round as circuses, and separated by a mole connecting
Alexandria with the craggy island upon which the Pharos-tower
rises—quadrangular, five hundred cubits high, nine storied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> having at
its summit a smoking heap of black coals.</i></p>
<p><i>Small interior ports open into the larger ones. The mole terminates at
each end in a bridge supported upon marble columns planted in the sea.
Sailing vessels pass beneath it, while heavy lighters overladen with
merchandise, thalamegii<a id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_6">[1]</a> inlaid with ivory, gondolas covered with
awnings, triremes, biremes, and all sorts of vessels are moving to and
fro, or lie moored at the wharves.</i></p>
<p><i>About the Great Port extends an unbroken array of royal construction:
the palace of the Ptolomies, the Museum, the Posidium, the Cæsareum,
the Timonium where Mark Anthony sought refuge, the Soma which contains
the tomb of Alexander; while at the other extremity of the city, beyond
the Eunostus, the great glass factories, perfume factories, and papyrus
factories may be perceived in a suburban quarter.</i></p>
<p><i>Strolling peddlers, porters, ass-drivers run and jostle together.
Here and there one observes some priest of Isis wearing a panther skin
on his shoulders, a Roman soldier with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> his bronze helmet, and many
negroes. At the thresholds of the shops women pause, artisans ply their
trades; and the grinding noise of chariot wheels puts to flight the
birds that devour the detritus of the butcher-shops and the morsels of
fish left upon the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>The general outline of the streets seems like a black network flung
upon the white uniformity of the houses. The markets stocked with
herbs make green bouquets in the midst of it; the drying-yards of the
dyers, blotches of color; the golden ornaments of the temple-pediments,
luminous points—all comprised within the oval enclosure of the grey
ramparts, under the vault of the blue heaven, beside the motionless
sea.</i></p>
<p><i>But suddenly the movement of the crowd ceases; all turn their
eyes toward the west, whence enormous whirlwinds of dust are seen
approaching.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the coming of the monks of the Thebaid, all clad in goatskins,
armed with cudgels, roaring a canticle of battle and of faith with the
refrain</i>:</p>
<p>"Where are they? Where are they?"</p>
<p><i>Anthony understands that they are coming to kill the Arians.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The streets are suddenly emptied—only flying feet are visible.</i></p>
<p><i>The Solitaries are now in the city. Their formidable cudgels, studded
with nails, whirl in the air like suns of steel. The crash of things
broken in the houses is heard. There are intervals of silence. Then
great screams arise.</i></p>
<p><i>From one end of the street to the other there is a continual eddy of
terrified people.</i></p>
<p><i>Many grasp pikes. Sometimes two bands meet, rush into one; and this
mass of men slips upon the pavement—fighting, disjointing, knocking
down. But the men with the long hair always reappear.</i></p>
<p><i>Threads of smoke begin to escape from the corners of edifices! folding
doors burst open. Portions of walls crumble down. Architraves fall.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony finds all his enemies again, one after the other. He even
recognizes some whom he had altogether forgotten; before killing them
he outrages them. He disembowels—he severs throats—he fells as in
a slaughter house—he hales old men by the beard, crushes children,
smites the wounded. And vengeance is taken upon luxury, those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> who
do not know how to read tear up hooks; others smash and deface the
statues, paintings, furniture, caskets,—a thousand dainty things
the use of which they do not know, and which simply for that reason
exasperates them. At intervals they pause, out of breath, in the work
of destruction; then they recommence.</i></p>
<p><i>The inhabitants moan in the courtyards where they have sought refuge.
The women raise their tearful eyes and lift their naked arms to heaven.
In hope of moving the Solitaries they embrace their knees; the men cast
them off and fling them down, and the blood gushes to the ceilings,
falls back upon the walls like sheets of rain, streams from the trunks
of decapitated corpses, fills the aqueducts, forms huge red pools upon
the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony is up to his knees in it. He wades in it; he sucks up the
blood-spray on his lips; he is thrilled with joy as he feels it upon
his limbs, under his hair-tunic which is soaked through with it.</i></p>
<p><i>Night comes. The immense uproar dies away.</i></p>
<p><i>The Solitaries have disappeared.</i></p>
<p><i>Suddenly, upon the outer galleries corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> to each of the nine
stories of the Pharos, Anthony observes thick black lines forming, like
lines of crows perching. He hurries thither; and soon finds himself at
the summit.</i></p>
<p><i>A huge mirror of brass turned toward the open sea, reflects the forms
of the vessels in the offing.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony amuses himself by watching them; and while he watches, their
number increases.</i></p>
<p><i>They are grouped together within a gulf which has the form of a
crescent. Upon a promontory in the background, towers a new city of
Roman architecture, with cupolas of stone, conical roofs, gleams of
pink and blue marbles, and a profusion of brazen ornamentation applied
to the volutes of the capitals, to the angles of the cornices, to the
summits of the edifices. A cypress-wood overhangs the city. The line of
the sea is greener, the air colder. The mountains lining the horizon
are capped with snow.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony is trying to find his way, when a man approaches him, and
says</i>:</p>
<p>"Come! they are waiting for you."</p>
<p><i>He traverses a forum, enters a great court, stoops beneath a low
door; and he arrives before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> the facade of the palace, decorated
with a group in wax, representing Constantine overcoming a dragon.
There is a porphyry basin, from the centre of which rises a golden
conch-shell full of nuts. His guide tells him that he may take some of
them. He does so. Then he is lost, as it were, in a long succession of
apartments.</i></p>
<p><i>There are mosaics upon the walls representing generals presenting
the Emperor with conquered cities, which they hold out upon the
palms of their hands. And there are columns of basalt everywhere,
trellis-work in silver filigree, ivory chairs, tapestries embroidered
with pearls. The light falls from the vaults above; Anthony still
proceeds. Warm exhalations circulate about him; occasionally he hears
the discreet clapping sound of sandals upon the pavement. Posted in
the anti-chambers are guards, who resemble automata, holding wands of
vermillion upon their shoulders.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><i>At last he finds himself in a great hall, with hyacinth-colored
curtains at the further end. They part, and display the Emperor seated
on a throne, clad in a violet tunic, and wearing red shoes striped with
bands of black.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>
<p><i>A diadem of pearls surround his head; his locks are arranged
symmetrically in rouleaux. He has a straight nose, drooping eyelids,
a heavy and cunning physiognomy. At the four corners of the dais
stretched above his head are placed four golden doves; and at the foot
of the throne are two lions in enamel crouching. The doves begin to
sing, the lions to roar. The Emperor rolls his eyes; Anthony advances;
and forthwith, without preamble, they commence to converse about
recent events. In the cities of Antioch, Ephesus, and Alexandria,
the temples have been sacked, and the statues of the gods converted
into pots and cooking utensils; the Emperor laughs heartily about it.
Anthony reproaches him with his tolerance toward the Novations. But the
Emperor becomes vexed. Novations, Arians or Meletians—he is sick of
them all! Nevertheless, he admires the episcopate; for inasmuch as the
Christians maintain bishops, who depend for their position upon five or
six important personages, it is only necessary to gain over the latter,
in order to have all the rest on one's side. Therefore he did not fail
to furnish them with large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> sums. But he detests the Fathers of the
Council of Nicæa.</i></p>
<p>"Let us go and see them!"</p>
<p><i>Anthony follows him.</i></p>
<p><i>And they find themselves on a terrace, upon the same floor.</i></p>
<p><i>It overlooks a hippodrome thronged with people, and surmounted by
porticoes where other spectators are walking to and fro. From the
centre of the race-course rises a narrow platform of hewn stone,
supporting a little temple of Mercury, the statue of Constantine, and
three serpents of brass twisted into a column; there are three huge
wooden eggs at one end, and at the other a group of seven dolphins with
their tails in the air.</i></p>
<p><i>Behind the imperial pavilion sit the Prefects of the Chambers, the
Counts of the Domestics, and the Patricians—in ranks rising by tiers
to the first story of a church whose windows are thronged with women.
On the right is the tribune of the Blue Faction; on the left, that of
the Green; below, a picket of soldiers is stationed; and on a level
with the arena is a row of Corinthian arches, forming the entrances to
the stables.</i></p>
<p><i>The races are about to commence; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> horses are drawn up in line.
Lofty plumes, fastened between their ears, bend to the wind like
saplings; and with every restive bound, they shake their chariots
violently, which are shell-shaped, and conducted by charioteers clad
in a sort of multi-colored cuirass, having sleeves tight at the wrist
and wide in the arms; their legs are bare; their beards, faces and
foreheads are shaven after the manner of the Huns.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony is at first deafened by the billowy sound of voices. From
the summit of the hippodrome to its lowest tiers, he sees only faces
painted with rouge, garments checkered and variegated with many colors,
flashing jewelry; and the sand of the arena, all white, gleams like a
mirror.</i></p>
<p><i>The Emperor entertains him. He confides to him many matters of high
importance, many secrets; he confesses the assassination of his son
Criopus, and even asks Anthony for advice regarding his health.</i></p>
<p><i>Meanwhile Anthony notices some slaves in the rear portion of the
stables below. They are the Fathers of Nicæa, ragged and abject. The
martyr Paphnutius is brushing the mane of one horse; Theophilus is
washing the legs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> of another; John is painting the hoofs of a third;
Alexander is collecting dung in a basket.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony passes through the midst of them. They range themselves on
either side respectfully; they beseech his intercession; they kiss his
hands. The whole assemblage of spectators hoots at them; and he enjoys
the spectacle with immeasurable pleasure. Lo! he is now one of the
grandees of the Court—the Emperor's confidant—the prime minister!
Constantine places his own diadem upon his brows. Anthony allows it to
remain upon his head, thinking this honor quite natural.</i></p>
<p><i>And suddenly in the midst of the darkness a vast hall appears,
illuminated by golden candelabra.</i></p>
<p><i>Candles so lofty that they are half lost in the darkness, stretch away
in huge files beyond the lines of banquet-tables, which seem to extend
to the horizon, where through a luminous haze loom superpositions of
stairways, suites of arcades, colossi, towers, and beyond all a vague
border of palace walls, above which rise the crests of cedars, making
yet blacker masses of blackness against the darkness.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The guests, crowned with violet wreaths, recline upon very low couches
and are leaning upon their elbows. Along the whole length of this
double line of couches, wine is being poured out from amphoræ, and at
the further end, all alone, coiffed with the tiara and blazing with
carbuncles, King Nebuchadnezzar eats and drinks.</i></p>
<p><i>On his right and left, two bands of priests in pointed caps are
swinging censers. On the pavement below crawl the captive kings whose
hands and feet have been cut off; from time to time he flings them
bones to gnaw. Further off sit his brothers, with bandages across their
eyes, being all blind.</i></p>
<p><i>From the depths of the ergastula arise moans of ceaseless pain. Sweet
slow sounds of a hydraulic organ alternate with choruses of song; and
one feels that all about the palace without extends an immeasurable
city—an ocean of human life whose waves break against the walls. The
slaves run hither and thither carrying dishes. Women walk between the
ranks of guests, offering drinks to all; the baskets groan under their
burthen of loaves; and a dromedary, laden with perforated water-skins:
passes and repasses through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> the hall, sprinkling and cooling the
pavement with vervain.</i></p>
<p><i>Lion tamers are leading tamed lions about. Dancing girls—their
hair confined in nets—balance themselves and turn upon their hands,
emitting fire through their nostrils; negro boatmen are juggling; naked
children pelt each other with pellets of snow, which burst against the
bright silverware. There is an awful clamor as of a tempest; and a huge
cloud hangs over the banquet—so numerous are the meats and breaths.
Sometimes a flake of fire torn from the great flambeaux by the wind,
traverses the night like a shooting star.</i></p>
<p><i>The king wipes the perfumes from his face with his arm. He eats from
the sacred vessels—then breaks them; and secretly reckons up the
number of his fleets, his armies, and his subjects. By and by, for a
new caprice, he will burn his palace with all its guests. He dreams of
rebuilding the tower of Babel, and dethroning God.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony, from afar off, reads all these thoughts upon his brow. They
penetrate his own brain, and he becomes Nebuchadnezzar. Immediately he
is cloyed with orgiastic excesses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> sated with fury of extermination;
and a great desire comes upon him to wallow in vileness. For the
degradation of that which terrifies men is an outrage inflicted upon
their minds—it affords yet one more way to stupefy them; and as
nothing is viler than a brute, Anthony goes upon the table on all
fours, and bellows like a bull.</i></p>
<p><i>He feels a sudden pain in his hand—a pebble has accidentally wounded
him—and he finds himself once more in front of his cabin.</i></p>
<p><i>The circle of the rocks is empty. The stars are glowing in the sky.
All is hushed.</i>)</p>
<p>"Again have I allowed myself to be deceived! Why these things? They
come from the rebellion of the flesh. Ah! wretch!"</p>
<p>(<i>He rushes into his cabin, and seizes a bunch of thongs, with metallic
hooks attached to their ends, strips himself to the waist and, lifting
his eyes to heaven exclaims</i>:)</p>
<p>"Accept my penance, O my God: disdain it not for its feebleness. Render
it sharp, prolonged, excessive! It is time, indeed!—to the work!"</p>
<p>(<i>He gives himself a vigorous lash—and shrieks.</i>)</p>
<p>"No! no!—without mercy it must be."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>(<i>He recommences.</i>)</p>
<p>"Oh! oh! oh! each lash tears my skin, rends my limbs! It burns me
horribly!"</p>
<p>"Nay!—it is not so very terrible after all!—one becomes accustomed to
it. It even seems to me...."</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony pauses.</i>)</p>
<p>"Continue, coward! continue! Good! good!—upon the arms, on the back,
on the breast, on the belly—everywhere! Hiss, ye thongs! bite me!
tear me! I would that my blood could spurt to the stars!—let my bones
crack!—let my tendons be laid bare! O for pincers, racks, and melted
lead! The martyrs have endured far worse; have they not, Ammonaria?"</p>
<p>(<i>The shadow of the Devil's horns reappears.</i>)</p>
<p>"I might have been bound to the column opposite to thine,—face to
face—under thy eyes—answering thy shrieks by my sighs; and our pangs
might have been interblended, our souls intermingled."</p>
<p>(<i>He lashes himself with fury.</i>)</p>
<p>"What! what! again. Take that!—But how strange a titillation thrills
me! What punishment! what pleasure! I feel as though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> receiving
invisible kisses; the very marrow of my bones seems to melt. I die...."</p>
<p><i>And he sees before him three cavaliers, mounted upon onagers, clad in
robes of green—each holding a lily in his hand, and all resembling
each other in feature.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony turns round, and beholds three other cavaliers exactly
similar, riding upon similar onagers, and preserving the same attitude.</i></p>
<p><i>He draws back. Then all the onagers advance one pace at the same time,
and rub their noses against him, trying to bite his garment. Voices
shout</i>:—</p>
<p>"Here! here! this way!"</p>
<p><i>And between the clefts of the mountain, appear standards,—camels'
heads with halters of red silk—mules laden with baggage, and women
covered with yellow veils, bestriding piebald horses.</i></p>
<p><i>The panting beasts lie down; the slaves rush to the bales and
packages, motley-striped carpets are unrolled; precious glimmering
things are laid upon the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>A white elephant, caparisoned with a golden net, trots forward,
shaking the tuft of ostrich plumes attached to his head-band.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Upon his back, perched on cushions of blue wool, with her legs
crossed, her eyes half closed, her comely head sleepily nodding, is a
woman so splendidly clad that she radiates light about her. The crowd
falls prostrate; the elephant bends his knees; and</i></p>
<p class="smcap" style="text-align: center;">The Queen of Sheba</p>
<p><i>letting herself glide down from his shoulder upon the carpets spread
to receive her, approaches Saint Anthony.</i></p>
<p><i>Her robe of gold brocade, regularly divided by furbelows of pearls,
of jet, and of sapphires, sheaths her figure closely with its
tight-fitting bodice, set off by colored designs representing the
twelve signs of the Zodiac. She wears very high pattens—one of which
is black, and sprinkled with silver stars, with a moon crescent; the
other, which is white, is sprinkled with a spray of gold, with a golden
sun in the middle.</i></p>
<p><i>Her wide sleeves, decorated with emeralds and bird-plumes, leave
exposed her little round bare arms, clasped at the wrist by ebony
bracelets; and her hands, loaded with precious rings, are terminated by
nails so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> sharply pointed that the ends of her fingers seem almost like
needles.</i></p>
<p><i>A chain of dead gold, passing under her chin, is caught up on either
side of her face, and spirally coiled about her coiffure, whence,
redescending, it grazes her shoulders and is attached upon her bosom
to a diamond scorpion, which protrudes a jewelled tongue between her
breasts. Two immense blond pearls depend heavily from her ears. The
borders of her eyelids are painted black. There is a natural brown spot
upon her left cheek; and she opens her mouth in breathing, as if her
corset inconvenienced her.</i></p>
<p><i>She shakes, as she approaches, a green parasol with an ivory handle,
and silver-gilt bells attached to its rim; twelve little woolly-haired
negro-boys support the long train of her robe, whereof an ape holds the
extremity, which it raises up from time to time. She exclaims</i>:</p>
<p>"Ah! handsome hermit! handsome hermit!—my heart swoons!</p>
<p>"By dint of stamping upon the ground with impatience, callosities have
formed upon my heel, and I have broken one of my nails. I sent out
shepherds, who remained upon the mountain tops, shading their eyes with
their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> hands—and hunters who shouted thy name in all the forests—and
spies who travelled along the highways, asking every passer-by:</p>
<p>"'Hast thou seen him?'</p>
<p>"By night I wept, with my face turned to the wall. And at last my tears
made two little holes in the mosaic, like two pools of water among the
rocks;—for I love thee!—oh! how I love thee!"</p>
<p>(<i>She takes him by the beard.</i>)</p>
<p>"Laugh now, handsome hermit! laugh! I am very joyous, very gay: thou
shalt soon see! I play the lyre; I dance like a bee; and I know a host
of merry tales to tell, each more diverting than the other.</p>
<p>"Thou canst not even imagine how mighty a journey we have made. See!
the onagers upon which the green couriers rode are dead with fatigue!"</p>
<p>(<i>The onagers are lying motionless upon the ground.</i>)</p>
<p>"For three long moons they never ceased to gallop on with the same
equal pace, holdings flints between their teeth to cut the wind, their
tails ever streaming out behind them, their sinews perpetually strained
to the uttermost, always galloping, galloping. Never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> can others be
found like them. They were bequeathed me by my paternal grand-father,
the Emperor Saharil, son of Iakhschab, son of Iaarab, son of Kastan.
Ah! if they were still alive, we should harness them to a litter that
they might bear us back speedily to the palace! But ... what ails
thee?—of what art thou dreaming?"</p>
<p>(<i>She stares at him, examines him closely.</i>)</p>
<p>"Ah, when thou shalt be my husband, I will robe thee, I will perfume
thee, I will depilate thee."</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony remains motionless, more rigid than a stake, more pallid
than a corpse.</i>)</p>
<p>"Thou hast a sad look—is it because of leaving thy hermitage? Yet I
have left everything for thee—even King Solomon, who, nevertheless,
possesses much wisdom, twenty thousand chariots of war, and a beautiful
beard. I have brought thee my wedding gifts. Choose!"</p>
<p>(<i>She walks to and fro among the ranks of slaves and the piles of
precious goods.</i>)</p>
<p>"Here is Genezareth balm, incense from Cape Gardefui, labdanum,
cinnamon, and silphium—good to mingle with sauces. In that bale are
Assyrian embroideries, ivory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> from the Ganges, purple from Elissa;
and that box of snow contains a skin of chalybon, the wine, which
is reserved for the Kings of Assyria, and which is drunk from the
horn of a unicorn. Here are necklaces, brooches, nets for the hair,
parasols, gold powder from Baasa, cassiteria from Tartessus, blue wood
from Pandio, white furs from Issidonia, carbuncles from the Island
Palæsimondus, and toothpicks made of the bristles of the tachas—that
lost animal which is found under the earth. These cushions come from
Emath, and these mantle-fringes from Palmyra. On this Babylonian carpet
there is.... But come hither! come! come!"</p>
<p>(<i>She pulls Saint Anthony by the sleeve. He resists. She continues</i>:)</p>
<p>"This thin tissue which crackles under the finger with a sound as of
sparks, is the famous yellow cloth which the merchants of Bactria bring
us. I will have robes made of it for thee, which thou shalt wear in the
house. Unfasten the hooks of that sycamore box, and hand me also the
little ivory casket tied to my elephant's shoulder."</p>
<p>(<i>They take something round out of a box—something covered with a
cloth—and also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> bring a little ivory casket covered with carving.</i>)</p>
<p>"Dost thou desire the buckler of Dgian-ben-Dgian, who built the
pyramids?—behold it!—It is formed of seven dragon-skins laid one over
the other, tanned in the bile of parricides, and fastened together by
adamantine screws. Upon one side are represented all the wars that have
taken place since the invention of weapons; and upon the other, all the
wars that will take place until the end of the world. The lightning
itself rebounds from it like a ball of cork. I am going to place it
upon thy arm; and thou wilt carry it during the chase.</p>
<p>"But if thou didst only know what I have in this little box of mine!
Turn it over and over again! try to open it! No one could ever succeed
in doing that. Kiss me! and I will tell thee how to open it."</p>
<p>(<i>She takes Saint Anthony by both cheeks. He pushes her away at arms'
length.</i>)</p>
<p>"It was one night that King Solomon lost his head. At last we concluded
a bargain. He arose, and stealing out on tiptoe...."</p>
<p>(<i>She suddenly executes a pirouette.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, ah! comely hermit, thou shalt not know it! thou shalt not know!"</p>
<p>(<i>She shakes her parasol, making all its little bells tinkle.</i>)</p>
<p>"And I possess many other strange things—oh! yes! I have treasures
concealed in winding galleries where one would lose one's way, as
in a forest. I have summer-palaces constructed in trellis-work of
reeds, and winter-palaces all built of black marble. In the midst of
lakes vast as seas, I have islands round as pieces of silver, and all
covered with mother-of-pearl,—islands whose shores make music to
the lapping of tepid waves upon the sand. The slaves of my kitchens
catch birds in my aviaries, and fish in my fishponds. I have engravers
continually seated at their benches to hollow out my likeness in hard
jewel-stones, and panting molders forever casting statues of me, and
perfumers incessantly mingling the sap of rare plants with vinegar,
or preparing cosmetic pastes. I have female dressmakers cutting out
patterns in richest material, goldsmiths cutting and mounting jewels of
price, and careful painters pouring upon my palace wainscoting boiling
resins, which they subsequently cool with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> fans. I have enough female
attendants to form a harem, eunuchs enough to make an army. I have
armies likewise; I have nations! In the vestibule of my palace I keep a
guard of dwarfs—all bearing ivory trumpets at their backs." (<i>Anthony
sighs.</i>)</p>
<p>"I have teams of trained gazelles; I have elephant quadrigæ; I have
hundreds of pairs of camels, and mares whose manes are so long that
their hoofs become entangled therein when they gallop, and herds of
cattle with horns so broad that when they go forth to graze the woods
have to be hewn down before them. I have giraffes wandering in my
gardens; they stretch their heads over the edge of my roof, when I take
the air after dinner.</p>
<p>"Seated in a shell drawn over the waters by dolphins, I travel
through the grottoes, listening lo the dropping of the water from the
stalactites. I go down to the land of diamonds, where my friends the
magicians allow me to choose the finest: then I reascend to earth and
return to my home."</p>
<p>(<i>She utters a sharp whistle; and a great bird, descending from the
sky, alights upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> her hair, from which it makes the blue powder fall.</i></p>
<p><i>Its orange-colored plumage seems formed of metallic scales. Its little
head, crested with a silver tuft, has a human face.</i></p>
<p><i>It has four wings, the feet of a vulture, and an immense peacock's
tail which it spreads open like a fan.</i></p>
<p><i>It seizes the Queen's parasol in its beak, reels a moment ere
obtaining its balance; then it erects all its plumes, and remains
motionless.</i>)</p>
<p>"Thanks! my beautiful Simorg-Anka!—thou didst tell me where the loving
one was hiding! Thanks! thanks! my heart's messenger!</p>
<p>"He flies swiftly as Desire! He circles the world in his flight. At eve
he returns; he perches at the foot of my couch and tells me all he has
seen—the seas that have passed far beneath him with all their fishes
and ships, the great void deserts he has contemplated from the heights
of the sky, the harvests that were bowing in the valleys, and the
plants that were growing upon the walls of cities abandoned."</p>
<p>(<i>She wrings her hands, languorously.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh! if thou wast willing! if thou wast willing!... I have a pavilion
on a promontory in the middle of an isthmus dividing two oceans. It is
all wain-scoted with sheets of glass, and floored with tortoise shell,
and open to the four winds of heaven. From its height I watch my fleets
come in, and my nations toiling up the mountain-slopes with burthens
upon their shoulders. There would we sleep upon downs softer than
clouds; we would drink cool draughts from fruit-shells, and we would
gaze at the sun through emeralds! Come!" ...</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony draws back. She approaches him again, and exclaims in a tone
of vexation</i>:—)</p>
<p>"How? neither the rich, nor the coquettish, nor the amorous woman can
charm thee: is it so? None but a lascivious woman, with a hoarse voice
and lusty person, with fire-colored hair and superabundant flesh? Dost
thou prefer a body cold as the skin of a serpent, or rather great dark
eyes deeper than the mystic caverns?—behold them, my eyes!—look into
them!"</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony, in spite of him, gazes into her eyes.</i>)</p>
<p>"All the women thou hast ever met—from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> the leman of the cross-roads,
singing under the light of her lantern, even to the patrician lady
scattering rose-petals abroad from her litter,—all the forms thou hast
ever obtained glimpses of—all the imaginations of thy desire thou hast
only to ask for them! I am not a woman: I am a world! My cloak has only
to fall in order that thou mayest discover a succession of mysteries."
(<i>Anthony's teeth chatter.</i>)</p>
<p>"Place but thy finger upon my shoulder: it will be as though a stream
of fire shot through all thy veins. The possession of the least part
of me will fill thee with a joy more vehement than the conquest of an
Empire could give thee! Approach thy lips: there is a sweetness in my
kisses as of a fruit dissolving within thy heart. Ah! how thou wilt
lose thyself beneath my long hair, inhale the perfume of my bosom,
madden thyself with the beauty of my limbs: and thus, consumed by the
fire of my eyes, clasped within my arms as in a whirlwind...."</p>

What if thou dost deprive thyself of meats, of wine, of warmth, of
bath, of slaves, or honours?—dost thou not permit thy imagination to
offer thee banquets, perfumes, women, and the applause of multitudes?
Thy chastity is but a more subtle form of corruption, and thy contempt
of this world is but the impotence of thy hatred against it! Either
this it is that makes such as thyself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> so lugubrious, or else 'tis
doubt. The possession of truth giveth joy. Was Jesus sad? Did he not
travel in the company of friends, repose beneath the shade of olive
trees, enter the house of the publican, drink many cups of wine, pardon
the sinning woman, and assuage all sorrows? Thou!—thou hast no pity

savage madness that impels thee to repel the caress of a dog or to
frown upon the smile of a child."</p>

forsoth:—'My conviction is formed! wherefore argue further?'—and one

text of the law whereof one is ignorant! Dost thou imagine that thou
dost hold all wisdom in the hollow of thy hand?"</p>

all thy mortifications to move Him. We obtain merit only by our thirst
for truth. Religion alone cannot explain all things; and the solution
of problems ignored by thee can render faith still more invulnerable
and noble. Therefore, for our salvation we must communicate with our
brethren—otherwise the Church, the assembly of the faithful, would
be a meaningless word—and we must listen to all reasoning, despising
nothing, nor any person. The magician Balaam, the poet Aeschylus,
and the Sybil of Cumæ—all foretold the Saviour. Dionysius, the
Alexandrian, received from heaven the command to read all books. Saint
Clement orders us to cultivate Greek letters. Hennas was converted by
the illusion of a woman he had loved...."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What an aspect of authority! It seems to me thou art growing
taller...."</p>
<p>(<i>And, in very truth, the stature of Hilarion is gradually increasing;

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Reassure thyself, good Hermit. Let us seat ourselves there,
upon that great stone, as we used to do in other years, when, at the
first dawn of day, I was wont to salute thee with the appellation,
'Clear star of morning'—and thou wouldst therewith commence to
instruct me. Yet my instruction is not yet completed. The moon gives us
light enough. I am prepared to hear thy words."</p>
<p>(<i>He has drawn a calamus from his girdle, and seating himself
cross-legged upon the ground, with the papyrus roll still in his hand,
he lifts his face toward Saint Anthony, who sits near him, with head
bowed down.</i></p>
<p><i>After a moment of silence Hilarion continues</i>:—)</p>
<p>"Is not the word of God confirmed for us by miracles? Nevertheless
the magicians of Pharaoh performed miracles; other imposters can
perform them; one may be thereby deceived. What then is a miracle?
An event which seems to us outside of nature. But do we indeed know
all of Nature's powers; and because a common occurrence causes us no
astonishment, does it therefore follow that we understand it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "It matters little! We must believe the Scriptures!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Saint Paul, Origen, and many others did not understand
the Scriptures in a literal sense: yet if Holy Writ be explained by
allegories it becomes the portion of a small number, and the evidence
of the truth disappears. What must we do?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "We must rely upon the Church!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Then the Scriptures are useless?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "No! no! although I acknowledge that in the Old Testament
there are some ... some obscurities. But the New shines with purest
light."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Nevertheless, the Angel of the annunciation, in Matthew,
appears to Joseph; while, in Luke, he appears to Mary. The anointing
of Jesus by a woman takes place, according to the first Gospel, at the
commencement of his public life; and, according to the other three, a
few days before his death. The drink offered to him on the cross, is,
in Matthew, vinegar mixed with gall; in Mark, it is wine and myrrh.
According to Luke and Matthew, the apostles should take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> with them
neither money nor scrip for their journey—not even sandals nor staff;
in Mark, on the contrary, Jesus bids them take nothing with them,
except sandals and a staff. I am thereby bewildered!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>in amazement</i>). "Aye, indeed!... in fact...."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "At the contact of the woman who had an issue of blood, Jesus
turned and said, 'Who hath touched my garments?' He did not know, then,
who had touched him? That contradicts the omniscience of Jesus! If the
tomb was watched by guards, the women need have felt no anxiety about
finding help to roll away the stone from the tomb. Therefore there
were no guards, or the holy women were not there. At Emmaus, he eats
with his disciples and makes them feel his wounds. It is a human body,
a material and ponderable object; and nevertheless it passes through
walls! Is that possible?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "It would require much time to answer thee properly!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Why did he receive the Holy Spirit, being himself Son of
the Holy Spirit? What need had he of baptism if he was the Word? How
could the Devil have tempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> him, inasmuch as he was God? Have these
thoughts never occurred to thee?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Yes!... often! Sometimes torpid, sometimes furious—they
remain forever in my conscience. I crush them; they rise again, they
stifle me; and sometimes I think that I am accursed."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Then it is needless for thee to serve God?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "I shall always need to adore Him."</p>
<p>(<i>After a long silence Hilarion continues</i>:)</p>
<p>"But aside from dogma, all researches are allowed us. Dost thou desire
to know the hierarchy of the Angels, the virtue of the Numbers, the
reason of germs and of metamorphoses?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Yes! yes! my thought struggles wildly to escape from its
prison. It seems to me that by exerting all my force I might succeed.
Sometimes, for an instant, brief as a lightning flash, I even feel
myself as thought uplifted,—then I fall back again!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "The secret thou wouldst obtain is guarded by sages. They
dwell in a distant land; they are seated beneath giant trees; they
are robed in white; they are calm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> as Gods! A warm air gives them
sufficient nourishment. All about them, leopards tread upon grassy
turf. The murmuring of fountains and the neighing of unicorns mingle
with their voices. Thou shalt hear them; and the face of the Unknown
shall be unveiled!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>sighing</i>). "The way is long; and I am old."</p>

<p>(<i>And Anthony beholds before him a vast basilica.</i></p>
<p><i>The light gushes from the further end, marvellous as a multi-colored
sun. It illuminates the innumerable heads of the crowd that fills the
nave, and that eddies about the columns toward the side-aisles—where
can be perceived, in wooden compartments, altars, beds, little chains
of blue stones linked together, and constellations painted upon the
walls.</i></p>
<p><i>In the midst of the throng there are groups which remain motionless.
Men standing upon stools harangue with fingers uplifted; others are
praying, with arms outstretched in form of a cross; others are lying
prostrate upon the pavement, or singing hymns, or drinking wine; others
of the faithful, seated about a table, celebrate their agape;<a id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_8">[1]</a>

aged men, leaning upon staffs, recount their voyages.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p><i>There are some from the country of the Germans, from Thrace also, and
from the Gauls, from Scythia and from the Indies, with snow upon their
beards, feathers in their hair; thorns in the fringe of their garments;
the sandals of some are black with dust, their skins are burnt by the
sun. There is a vast confusion of costumes, mantles of purple and
robes of linen, embroidered dalmaticas, hair shirts, sailors' caps,
bishops' mitres. Their eyes fulgurate strangely. They have the look of
executioners, or the look of eunuchs.</i></p>
<p><i>Hilarion advances into their midst. All salute him. Anthony, shrinking
closer to his shoulder, observes them. He remarks the presence of a
great many women. Some of these are attired like men, and have their
hair cut short. Anthony feels afraid of them.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Those are Christian women who have converted their husbands.
Besides, the women were always upon the side of Jesus, even the
idolatrous ones, for example, Procula, the wife of Pilate, and Poppæa,
the concubine of Nero. Do not tremble!—come on."</p>
<p>(<i>And others are continually arriving.</i></p>
<p><i>They seem to multiply, to double themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> by self-division, light
as shadows—all the while making an immense clamour, in which yells of
rage, cries of love, canticles and objurgations intermingle.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>in a low voice</i>). "What do they desire?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "The Lord said: 'I have yet many things to say to you....

<p>(<i>And he pushes Anthony forward to a golden throne approached by five
steps, whereon—surrounded by ninety-five disciples, all very thin and
pale, and anointed with oil—sits the prophet Manes. He is beautiful
as an archangel, immobile as a statue; he is clad in an Indian robe;
carbuncles gleam in his plaited hair; at his left hand lies a book of
painted images; his right reposes upon a globe. The images represent
the creatures that erst slumbered in Chaos. Anthony bends forward to
look upon them. Then——</i>)</p>
<p class="smcap" style="text-align: center;">Manes</p>
<p>(<i>makes his globe revolve; and regulating the tone of his words by a
lyre which gives forth crystalline sounds, exclaims</i>:—)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>"The celestial earth is at the superior extremity; the terrestrial
earth at the inferior extremity. It is sustained by two angels—the
Angel Splenditeneus, and Omophorus, whose faces are six.</p>
<p>"At the summit of the highest heaven reigns the impassible Divinity;
below, face to face, are the Son of God and the Prince of Darkness.</p>
<p>"When the darkness had advanced even to his kingdom, God evolved from
his own essence a virtue which produced the first man; and he environed
him with the five elements. But the demons of darkness stole from him a
part; and that part is the soul.</p>
<p>"There is but one soul, universally diffused, even as the waters of
a river divided into many branches. It is this universal soul that
sighs in the wind—that shrieks in the marble under the teeth of the
saw—that roars in the voice of the sea—that weeps tears of milk when
the leaves of the fig tree are torn off.</p>
<p>"The souls that leave this world emigrate to the stars, which are
themselves animated beings."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>bursts into a laugh</i>). "Ah! ah! what an absurd imagination!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manes</span> (<i>continues</i>). "But first they remain awhile in the Moon, where
they are purified. Then they rise into the sun."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>slowly</i>). "I do not know of anything ... which prevents us
... from believing it."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Manes</span>. "The proper aim of every creature is the deliverance of the ray
of celestial light imprisoned within matter. It finds easier escape
through the medium of perfumes, spices, the aroma of warmed wine, the
light things which resemble thoughts. But the acts of life retain it
within its prison. The murderer shall be born again in the form of a
celephus; he that kills an animal shall become that animal; if thou
plantest a vine, thou shalt be thyself bound within its boughs. Food
absorbs the celestial light.... Therefore abstain! fast!"</p>

<p>(<i>After a long silence</i>): "How can that be?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Valentine</span>. "The most perfect of beings, and of the Æons, the Abyss;
dwelt in the womb of the Deep together with Thought. By their union was
begotten Intelligence, to whom Truth was given as a companion.</p>
<p>"Intelligence and Truth engendered the Word and Life, who in their turn
begat Man and the Church; and that doth make eight Æons!"</p>
<p>(<i>He counts upon his fingers.</i>)</p>
<p>"The Word and Truth also produced ten other Æons—which is to say, five
couples. Man and the Church had begotten twelve more—among these the
Paraclete and Faith, Hope and Charity, Perfection and Wisdom—Sophia.</p>
<p>"The union of these thirty Æons constitutes the Pleroma, or
Universality of God. Thus, even as the echo of a passing voice, as the
effluvia of a perfume evaporating, as the fires of the setting sun,
the Powers that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> emanated from the Principle, forever continue to grow
weaker.</p>
<p>"But Sophia, desirous to know the Father, darted from the Pleroma;
and the Word then made another couple, Christ and the Holy Ghost, who
reunited all the Æons; and all together formed Jesus, the flower of the
Pleroma.</p>
<p>"But the effort of Sophia to flee away had left in the void an image of
her—an evil substance, Acharamoth.<a id="FNanchor_4_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_11">[4]</a> The Saviour took pity upon her,
freed her from all passion; and from the smile of Acharamoth redeemed,
light was born; her tears formed the waters; by her sorrow was dark
matter begotten.</p>
<p>"Of Acharamoth was born the Demiurgos,—the fabricator of worlds,
the creator of the heaven and of the Devil. He dwells far below the
Pleroma—so far that he cannot behold it—so that he deems himself to
be the true God, and repeats by the mouths of his prophets—'There is
no other God but I.' Then he made man, and instilled into his soul the
immaterial Seed which was the Church—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> reflection of the other Church
established in the Pleroma.</p>
<p>"One day Acharamoth shall reach the highest region and unite herself
with the Saviour; the fire that is hidden in the world shall annihilate
all matter, and shall even devour itself and men, becoming pure
spirits, shall espouse the angels!"</p>

magician!—it is the Devil!' And the crowd stopped before our house, in
front of the Temple Æsculapius. I drew myself up with my hands to the
little window.</p>
<p>"Upon the peristyle of the temple, there stood a man who wore about his
neck a collar of iron. He took burning coals out of a chafing-dish, and
with them drew lines across his breast, the while crying out—'Jesus!
Jesus!' The people shouted—'This is not lawful! let us stone him!'
But he continued. Oh! those were unheard of marvels—things which
transported men who beheld them! Flowers broad as suns circled before
my eyes, and I heard in the spaces above me the vibrations of a golden
harp. Day died. My hands loosened their grasp of the window-bars; my
body fell back, and when he had led me away to his house...."</p>

when, at a turn in the road, we saw a man under a fig tree.</p>

words of abuse. The slaves ran up; he burst into a loud laugh. The
horses reared; the molossi all barked.</p>
<p>"He stood before us. The sweat streamed from his forehead; his mantle
napped in the wind.</p>
<p>"And calling us each by our names, he reproached us with the vanity
of our work, the infamy of our bodies; and he shook his fist at the
dromedaries because of the silver bells hanging below their mouths.</p>
<p>"His fury now filled my very entrails with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> fear and yet there was a
strange pleasure in it which fascinated me, intoxicated me!</p>
<p>"First the slaves came. 'Master,' they said, 'our animals are weary.'
Then the women said, 'We are frightened,' and the slaves departed. Then
the children began to weep,—'We are hungry.' And as the women were not
answered, they disappeared also from our view.</p>
<p>"He still spoke. I felt some one near me. It was my husband; but I
listened only to the other. My husband crawled to me upon his knees

Johanna, Martha and Susannah did not share the couch of the Saviour.
Souls may know the delirium of embrace better than bodies. That he

himself—loving his love more than his virility. And then, it was
no fault of mine. Sotas could not cure me; a spirit constrained me.

many mortifications, three Lents a year, and prayers to be uttered
nightly by the mind only, keeping the mouth closed, lest breathing

the better to explain her idea. Another, standing in the midst of an
assembly of Sampseans distributes, as a sacrament, the dust of her
own sandals. Upon the rose-strewn bed of the Marcosians, two lovers
embrace. The Circumcellionites<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> slaughter one another; the Valesians
utter the death-rattle; Bardesanes sings; Carpocras dances; Maximilla

naked, leaning upon a lion, and brandishing three torches, shrieks the
Terrible Invocation.</i></p>

tempest; the amulets suspended about the necks of the Heresiarchs seem
to cross each other in lines of fire; the constellations in the chapels
palpitate; and the walls recoil with the ebb and flow of the crowd, in
which each head is a wave that leaps and roars.</i></p>
<p><i>Nevertheless, from the midst of the clamor arises the sound of a song,

of woven grass to sit upon. From time to time there are bursts of
applause. He hears the sound of footsteps above his head.</i></p>
<p><i>Suddenly a long roar is heard, mighty and cavernous as the roar of
water in an aqueduct.</i></p>
<p><i>And he sees, directly opposite, behind the bars of another compartment
across the arena a lion walking to and fro, then a line of sandals,
bare legs, and purple fringes. Beyond are the vast circling wreaths
of people, in symmetrical tiers, enlarging as they rise, from the
lowest which hems in the arena to the uppermost above which masts
rise to sustain a hyacinth-colored awning, suspended in air by ropes.
Stairways radiating toward the centre, divide these huge circles of
stone at regular intervals. The benches disappear under a host of
spectators—knights, senators, soldiers, plebeians, vestals, and
courtesans—in woollen hoods, in silken maniples, in fallow-colored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
tunics; together with aigrettes of precious stones, plumes of feathers,
the fasces of lictors; and all this swarming multitude deafens and
stupefies Anthony with its shoutings, its tumultuous fury, as of an
enormous boiling vat. In the middle of the arena, a vase of incense
smokes upon an altar.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony thus knows that the people with him are Christians condemned
to be thrown to the wild beasts. The men wear the red mantle of the
pontiffs of Saturn; the women, the bandellettes of Ceres. Their friends
divide among themselves shreds of their garments, and rings. To obtain
access to the prison, they say, costs a great deal of money. But what
matter! They will remain until it is all over.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony notices among these consolers, a certain bald-headed man,
in a black tunic: Anthony has seen that face somewhere before. The
consoler discourses to them concerning the nothingness of this world,
and the felicity of the Elect. Anthony feels within him a transport of
celestial love; he longs for the opportunity to lay down his life for
the Saviour—not knowing as yet whether he himself is to be numbered
among the martyrs.</i></p>

will be converted by thy example."</p>
<p>(<i>And in the great den opposite, the lions stride back and forth,
ceaselessly, with a rapid continuous motion. The largest suddenly looks

columns, of bluish-grey color. These are tree-trunks, all originating
from one vast trunk. From each branch of the colossal tree descend
other branches which may bury themselves in the soil; and the aspect of
all these horizontal and perpendicular lines, indefinitely multiplied,
would closely resemble a monstrous timber-work, were it not that they
have small figs<a id="FNanchor_7_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_14">[7]</a> growing upon them here and there, and a blackish
foliage, like that of the sycamore.</i></p>
<p><i>He perceives in the forkings of their branches, hanging bunches of
yellow flowers, violet flowers also, and ferns that resemble the plumes
of splendid birds.</i></p>
<p><i>Under the lowest branches the horns of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> bubalus gleam at intervals,
and the bright eyes of antelopes are visible; there are hosts of
parrots; there are butterflies flittering hither and thither; lizards
lazily drag themselves up or down; flies buzz and hum; and in the midst
of the silence, a sound is audible as of the palpitation of a deep and
mighty life.</i></p>
<p><i>Seated upon a sort of pyre at the entrance of the wood is a strange
being—a man—besmeared with cow-dung, completely naked, more withered
than a mummy; his articulations form knots at the termination of bones
that resemble sticks. He has bunches of shells suspended from his ears;
his face is very long, and his nose like a vulture's beak. His left arm
remains motionlessly erect in air, anchylosed, rigid as a stake; and he
has been seated here so long that birds have made themselves a nest in
his long hair.</i></p>

directly in front of him. He gazes steadily at it with widely-opened
eyes; and, then without looking at Anthony, asks him</i>:—)</p>

eyes upon my nose, and contemplating the ether in my mind, the world in

<p>"All that is engendered will perish; all that is dead must live again;
the beings that have even now disappeared shall sojourn again in wombs
as yet unformed, and shall again return to earth to serve in woe other
creatures.</p>

no more! I abandon the filthy hostelry of this body of mine, built
with flesh, reddened with blood, covered with a hideous skin, full of
uncleanliness; and, for my recompense, I go at last to slumber in the

India. Kalanos burned himself before Alexander; another did likewise
in the time of Augustus. What hatred of life men must have to do thus!

they have the intrepidity of martyrs.... As for the latter, I can now
well believe what has been told me regarding the debauchery they cause.</p>

nights of Summer with my face."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>, (<i>tapping his own forehead</i>:—)</p>
<p>"Ah! ah! I comprehend! her head!..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>placing his finger to his lips</i>:—)</p>
<p>"Hush!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span>. "The sail remained well filled by the wind; the keel cleft the
foam. He said to me: 'What though I afflict my country, though I lose
my kingdom! Thou wilt belong to me, in my house!'</p>
<p>"How sweet was the lofty chamber of his palace! Lying upon the ivory
bed, he caressed my long hair, singing amorously the while.</p>
<p>"Even at the close of the day I beheld the two camps, the watchfires
being lighted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> Ulysses at the entrance of his tent, armed Achilles
driving a chariot along the sea-beach."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Why! she is utterly mad! How came this to pass?..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>. "Hush! hush!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Helena</span>. "They anointed me with unguents, and sold me to the people that
I might amuse them.</p>
<p>"One evening I was standing with the sistrum in my hand, making music
for some Greek sailors who were dancing. The rain was falling upon the
roof of the tavern like a cataract, and the cups of warm wine were
smoking.</p>
<p>"A man suddenly entered, although the door was not opened to let him
pass."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>. "It was I! I found thee again!</p>
<p>"Behold her, Anthony, she whom they call Sigeh, Ennoia, Barbelo,
Prounikos! The Spirits governing the world were jealous of her; and
they imprisoned her within the body of a woman.</p>
<p>"She was that Helen of Troy, whose memory was cursed by the poet
Stesichorus. She was Lucretia, the patrician woman violated by a king.
She was Delilah, by whom Samson's<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> locks were shorn.... She has loved
adultery, idolatry, lying and foolishness. She has prostituted herself
to all nations. She has sung at the angles of all cross-roads. She has
kissed the faces of all men.</p>
<p>"At Tyre, she, the Syrian, was the mistress of robbers. She caroused
with them during the nights; and she concealed assassins amidst the
vermin of her tepid bed."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Ah! what is this to me?..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>with a furious look</i>:—)</p>
<p>"I tell thee that I have redeemed her, and re-established her in her
former splendor; insomuch that Caius Cæsar Caligula became enamoured of
her, desiring to sleep with the Moon!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What then?..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>. "Why this, that she herself is the Moon! Has not Pope Clement
written how she was imprisoned in a tower? Three hundred persons
surrounded the tower to watch it; and the moon was seen at each of the
loop-holes at the same time, although there is not more than one moon
in the world, nor more than one Ennoia!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Yes ... it seems to me that I remember...."</p>
<p>(<i>He falls into a reverie.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>. "Innocent as the Christ who died for men, so did she devote
herself for women. For the impotence of Jehovah is proven by the
transgression of Adama, and we must shake off the yoke of the old law,
which is antipathetic to the order of things.<a id="FNanchor_9_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_16">[9]</a></p>
<p>"I have preached the revival in Ephraim and in Issachar by the torrent
of Bizor, beyond the Lake of Houleh, in the valley of Maggedo, further
than the mountains, at Bostra and at Damascus. Let all come to me who
are covered with wine, who are covered with filth, who are covered with
blood! and I shall take away their uncleanliness with the Holy Spirit,
called Minerva by the Greeks. She is Minerva! she is the Holy Spirit! I
am Jupiter, Apollo, the Christ, the Paraclete, the great might of God,
incarnated in the person of Simon!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Ah! it is thou!... so it is thou! But I know thy crimes!</p>
<p>"Thou wast born at Gittoi near Samaria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> Dositheas, thy first master,
drove thee from him. Thou didst execrate Saint Paul because he
converted one of thy wives; and, vanquished by Saint Peter, in thy rage
and terror thou didst cast into the waves the bag which contained thy
artifices!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span>. "Dost thou desire them?"</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony looks at him, and an interior voice whispers hi his
heart:—"Why not?"</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Simon</span> (<i>continues</i>).</p>
<p>"He who knows the forces of Nature and the essence of Spirits must be
able to perform miracles. It has been the dream of all sages; it is the
desire which even now gnaws thee!—confess it!"</p>
<p>"In the sight of the multitude of the Romans, I flew in the air so
high that none could behold me move. Nero ordered that I should be
decapitated; but it was the head of a sheep which fell upon the ground
in lieu of mine. At last they buried me alive; but I rose again upon
the third day. The proof is that thou dost behold me before thee!"</p>
<p>(<i>He presents his hands to Anthony to smell. They have the stench of
corpse-flesh. Anthony recoils with loathing.</i>)</p>
<p>"I can make serpents of bronze writhe; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> can make marble statues
laugh; I can make dogs speak. I will show thee vast quantities of gold;
I will reestablish kings; thou shalt see nations prostrate themselves
in adoration before me! I can walk upon the clouds and upon the waves,
I can pass through mountains, I can make myself appear as a youth, as
an old man, as a tiger, or as an ant; I can assume thy features; I can
give thee mine; I can make the thunder follow after me. Dost hear it?"</p>
<p>(<i>The thunder rumbles; flashes of lightning succeed.</i>)</p>
<p>"It is the voice of the Most High; for 'the Lord thy God is a fire;'
and all creations are accomplished by sparks from the fire-centre of
all things.</p>
<p>Thou shalt even now receive the baptism of it—that second baptism
announced by Jesus, which fell upon the apostles on a day of tempest
when the windows were open!"</p>
<p>(<i>And stirring up the flame with his hand, slowly, as though preparing

<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>who is a little man</i>).</p>
<p>"Nay! nay! be not angered, good hermit. As for that I seek, I know not
myself what it is! Here is the Master!"</p>
<p>(<i>He sits down. The other stranger remains standing. Silence.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>asks</i>).</p>
<p>"Then ye come?..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Oh! from afar off—very far off!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "And ye go?..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>pointing to the other</i>)</p>
<p>"Whithersoever he shall desire!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "But who may he be?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Look well upon him!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>
<p>"He looks like a saint! If I could only dare...."</p>
<p>(<i>The mist is all gone. The night is very clear. The moon shines.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Of what art thou dreaming, that thou dost not speak?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "I was thinking.... Oh! nothing!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>approaches Apollonius, and walks all round him several times,
bending himself as he walks, never raising his head</i>:—)</p>
<p>"Master, here is a Galilean hermit who desires to know the beginnings
of wisdom."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Let him approach!" (<i>Anthony hesitates.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Approach!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span> (<i>in a voice of thunder</i>:—)</p>
<p>"Approach! Thou wouldst know who I am, what I have done, and what I
think,—is it not so, child?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Always supposing that these things can contribute to the
salvation of my soul."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Rejoice! I am about to inform thee of them!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>in an undertone, to Anthony</i>:—)</p>
<p>"Is it possible? He must surely have at the first glance discerned in
thee extraordinary aptitude for philosophy. I shall also strive to
profit by his instruction."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "First of all, I shall tell thee of the long course which
I have followed in order to obtain the doctrine; and if thou canst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
discover in all my life one evil action, thou shalt bid me pause, for
he who hath erred in his actions may well give scandal by his words."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>to Anthony</i>).</p>
<p>"How just a man? Is he not?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Indeed I believe him to be sincere."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Upon the night of my birth, my mother imagined that
she was gathering flowers by the shore of a great lake. A flash of
lightning appeared; and she brought me into the world to the music of
the voices of swans singing to her in her dream.</p>
<p>"Until I had reached the age of fifteen I was plunged thrice a day into
the fountain, Asbadeus, whose waters make perjurers hydropical; and my
body was rubbed with the leaves of the onyza, that I might be chaste.</p>
<p>"A Palmyrian princess came one evening to seek me, offering me
treasures that she knew to be in the tombs. A hierodule of the temple
of Diana, slew herself in despair with the sacrificial knife; and the
governor of Cilicia, finding all his promises of no avail, cried out in
the presence of my family that he would cause my death; but it was he
that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> died only three days after, assassinated by the Romans."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>nudging Anthony with his elbow</i>).</p>
<p>"Eh? did I not tell thee? What a man!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "For the space of four successive years I maintained the
unbroken silence of the Pythagoreans. The most sudden and unexpected
pain never extorted a sigh from me; and when I used to enter the
theatre, all drew away from me, as from a phantom."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Wouldst thou have done so much?—thou?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "After the period of my trial had been accomplished, I
undertook to instruct the priests regarding the tradition they had
lost."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What tradition?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Interrupt him not! Be silent!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "I have conversed with the Samaneans of the Ganges, with
the astrologers of Chaldea, with the magi of Babylon, with the Gaulish
Druids, with the priests of the negroes! I have ascended the fourteen
Olympii; I have sounded the Scythian lakes; I have measured the breadth
of the Desert!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "It is all true! I was with him the while!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "But first I had visited the Hyrcanian Sea; I made the tour
of it; and descending by way of the country of the Baraomati, where
Bucephalus is buried, I approached the city of Nineveh. At the gates of
the city, a man drew near me...."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "I—even I, good master! I loved thee from the first. Thou wert
gentler than a girl and more beautiful than a god!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span> (<i>without hearing him</i>).</p>
<p>"He asked me to accompany him, that he might serve as interpreter."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "But thou didst reply that all languages were familiar to thee,
and that thou couldst divine all thoughts. Then I kissed the hem of thy
mantle, and proceeded to walk behind thee."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "After Ctesiphon, we entered upon the territory of Babylon."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "And the Satrap cried aloud on beholding a man so pale."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>
<p>"What signifies this?..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "The king received me standing, near a throne of silver,
in a hall constellated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> with stars; from the cupola hung suspended by
invisible threads four great birds of gold, with wings extended."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>dreamily</i>).</p>
<p>"Can there be such things in the world?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Ah! that is a city! that Babylon! everybody there is rich! The
houses, which are painted blue, have doors of bronze, and flights of
steps descending to the river."</p>
<p>(<i>Drawing lines upon the ground, with his stick</i>:)</p>
<p>"Like that, seest thou? And then there are temples, there are squares,
there are baths, there are aqueducts! The palaces are roofed with red
brass; and the interior ... ah! if thou only knewest!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Upon the north wall rises a tower which supports a second,
a third, a fourth, a fifth, and there are also three others! The eighth
is a chapel containing a bed. No one enters it save the woman chosen by
the priests for the God Belus. I was lodged there by order of the King
of Babylon."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "As for me, they hardly deigned to give me any attention! So I
walked through the streets all by myself. I informed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> myself regarding
the customs of the people; I visited the workshops; I examined the
great machines that carry water to the gardens. But I soon wearied of
being separated from the Master."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "At last we left Babylon; and as we travelled by the light
of the moon, we suddenly beheld an Empusa."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Aye, indeed! She leaped upon her iron hoof; she brayed like an
ass; she galloped among the rocks. He shouted imprecations at her; she
disappeared."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>aside</i>).</p>
<p>"What can be their motive?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "At Taxilla, the capital of five thousand fortresses,
Phraortes, King of the Ganges, showed us his guard of black men, whose
stature was five cubits, and under a pavilion of green brocade in his
gardens, an enormous elephant, which the queens amused themselves by
perfuming. It was the elephant of Porus which had taken flight after
the death of Alexander."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "And which had been found again in a forest."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Their speech is superabundant, like that of drunken men!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Phraortes seated us at his own table."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "How strange a country that was! During their drinking
carousels, the lords used to amuse-themselves by shooting arrows under
the feet of a dancing child. But I do not approve...."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "When I was ready to depart, the king gave me a parasol,
and he said to me: 'I have a stud of white camels upon the Indus. When
thou shalt have no further use for them, blow in their ears. They will
come back.'</p>
<p>"We descended along the river, marching at night by the light of the
fire-flies, which glimmered among the bamboos. The slave whistled an
air to drive away the serpents; and our camels bent down in passing
below the branches of the trees, as if passing under low gates.</p>
<p>"One day a black child, who held a golden caduceus in his hand,
conducted us to the College of the Sages. Iarchas, their chief, spoke
to me of my ancestors, told me of all my thoughts, of all my actions,
of all my existences. In former time he had been the River Indus; and
he reminded me that I had once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> been a boatman upon the Nile, in the
time of King Sesostris."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "As for me, they told me nothing; so that I know not who or what
I have been."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "They have a vague look, like shadows!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Upon the shores of the sea we met with the milk-gorged
Cynocephali, who were returning from their expedition to the Island
Taprobana. The tepid waves rolled blond pearls to our feet. The amber
crackled beneath our steps. Whale-skeletons were whitening in the
crevasses of the cliffs. At last the land became narrow as a sandal;
and after casting drops of ocean water toward the sun, we turned to the
right to return.</p>
<p>"So we returned through the Region of Aromatics, by way of the country
of the Gangarides, the promontory of Comaria, the country of the
Sachalites, of the Adramites and of the Homerites; then, across the
Cassanian mountains, the Red Sea, and the Island Topazos, we penetrated
into Ethiopia through the country of the Pygmies."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>to himself</i>).</p>
<p>"How vast the world is!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "And after we had returned home, we found that all those whom we
used to know, were dead."</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony lowers his head. Silence.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span> (<i>continues</i>).</p>
<p>"Then men began to talk of me the world over.</p>
<p>"The plague was ravaging Ephesus; I made them stone an old mendicant
there."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "And forthwith the plague departed."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What! Does he drive away pestilence?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "At Cnidos, I cured the man that had become enamored of
Venus."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Aye! a fool who had even vowed to espouse her! To love a woman
is at least comprehensible; but to love a statue—what madness! The
Master placed his hand upon the young man's heart; and the fire of that
love was at once extinguished."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "How! does he also cast out devils?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "At Tarentum they were carrying the dead body of a young
girl to the funeral pyre."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "The Master touched her lips; and she arose and called her
mother."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What! he raises the dead!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "I predicted to Vespasian his accession to power."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What! he foretells the future!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "At Corinth there was a ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "It was when I was at table with him, at the waters of Baia
..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Excuse me, strangers—it is very late ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "At Corinth there was a young man called Menippus ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "No! no!—go ye away!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "A dog came in, bearing a severed hand in his mouth."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "One evening, in one of the suburbs, he met a woman."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Do ye not hear me? Begone!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "He wandered in a bewildered way around the couches ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Enough!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "They sought to drive him out."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "So Menippus went with her to her house; they loved one
another."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "And gently beating the mosaic pavement with his tail, he
laid the severed hand upon the knees of Flavius."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "But next morning, during the lessons in the school, Menippus
was pale."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>starting up in anger</i>).</p>
<p>"Still continuing! Ah! then let them continue till they be weary,
inasmuch as there is no ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "The Master said to him: 'O beautiful youth, thou dost caress
a serpent; by a serpent thou art caressed! And when shall be the
nuptials?' We all went to the wedding."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Assuredly I am doing wrong, to hearken to such a story!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Servants were hurrying to and fro in the vestibule; doors were
opening; nevertheless there was no sound made either by the fall of
the footsteps nor the closing of the doors. The Master placed himself
beside Menippus. And the bride forthwith became angered against the
philosophers. But the vessels of gold, the cupbearers, the cooks, the
panthers disappeared; the roof receded and vanished into air; the walls
crumbled down; and Apollonius stood alone with the woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> at his feet,
all in tears. She was a vampire who satisfied the beautiful young men
in order to devour their flesh, for nothing is more desirable for such
phantoms than the blood of amorous youths."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "If thou shouldst desire to learn the art ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "I do not wish to learn anything!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "The same evening that we arrived at the gates of Rome ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Oh! yes!—speak to me rather of the City of Popes!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "A drunken man accosted us, who was singing in a low voice.
The song was an epithalamium of Nero; and he had the power to cause
the death of whosoever should hear it with indifference. In a box upon
his shoulders he carried a string taken from the Emperor's cithara. I
shrugged my shoulders. He flung mud in our faces. Then I unfastened my
girdle and placed it in this hand."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "In sooth, thou wert most imprudent!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "During the night the Emperor summoned me to his house. He
was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> playing at osselets with Sporus, supporting his left arm upon a
table of agate. He turned and, knitting his brows, demanded: 'How comes
it that thou dost not fear me?' 'Because,' I replied, 'the God who made
thee terrible, also made me intrepid."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>to himself</i>).</p>
<p>"There is something inexplicable that terrifies me!"</p>
<p>(<i>Silence.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>breaking the silence with his shrill voice</i>).</p>
<p>"Moreover, all Asia can tell thee ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>starting up</i>).</p>
<p>"I am ill! let me be!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "But listen! At Ephesus, he beheld them killing Domitian, who
was at Rome."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>with a forced laugh</i>). "Is it possible?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Yes: at the theatre at noon-day, the fourteenth of the Kalenda
of October, he suddenly cried out: 'Cæsar is being murdered!' and
from time to time he would continue to ejaculate: 'He rolls upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>pavement ... Oh! how he struggles ... He rises ... He tries to flee
... The doors are fastened ... Ah! it is all over! He is dead!' And in
fact Titus Flavius Domitianus was assassinated upon that very day, as
thou knowest."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Without the aid of the Devil ... certainly ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "He had purposed putting me to death, that same Domitian!
Damis had taken flight according to my order, and I remained alone in
my prison."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "A terrible hardihood on thy part, it must be confessed!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "About the fifth hour, the soldiers led me before the
tribunal. I had my harangue all ready hidden beneath my mantle."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "We others were then upon the shores of Puteoli, we believed
thee dead; we were all weeping, when all of a sudden about the sixth
hour, thou didst suddenly appear before us, exclaiming: 'It is I.'"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>to himself</i>). "Even as He...!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>in a very loud voice</i>). "Precisely!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "He descended from heaven. I rise thither, by the power of
my virtue that has lifted me up even to the height of the Principle of
all things!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Thyana, his natal city, has established in his honor a temple
and a priesthood!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span> (<i>draws near Anthony, and shouts in his ear</i>:—)</p>
<p>"It is because I know all gods, all rites, all prayers, all oracles!
I have penetrated into the cave of Trophonius, son of Apollo! I
have kneaded for Syracusan women the cakes which they carry to the
mountains. I have endured the eighty tests of Mithra! I have pressed to
my heart the serpent of Sabasius! I have received the scarf of Kabiri!
I have laved Cybele in the waters of the Campanian gulfs! and I have
passed three moons in the caverns of Samothracia!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>with a stupid laugh</i>).</p>
<p>"Ah! ah! ah! at the mysteries of the good Goddess!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "And now we recommence our pilgrimage.</p>
<p>"We go to the North to the land of Swans and of snows. Upon the vast
white plains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> the blind hippopodes break with the tips of their feet
the ultramarine plant."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Hasten! it is already dawn. The cock has crowed, the horse has
neighed, the sail is hoisted!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "The cock has not crowed! I hear the locusts in the sands, and
I see the moon still in her place."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "We go to the South, beyond the mountains and the mighty
waters, to seek in perfumes the secret source of love. Thou shalt
inhale the odor of myrrhodion which makes the weak die. Thou shalt
bathe thy body in the lake of Rose-oil which is in the Island Junonia.
Thou shalt see slumbering upon primroses that Lizard which awakes
every hundred years when the carbuncle upon its forehead, arriving
at maturity, falls to the ground. The stars palpitate like eyes; the
cascades sing like the melody of lyres; strange intoxication is exhaled
by blossoming flowers; thy mind shall grow vaster in that air; and thy
heart shall change even as thy face."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Master! it is time! The wind has risen, the swallows awaken,
the myrtle leaves are blown away."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Yes! let us go!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Nay! I remain here!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Shall I tell thee where grows the plant Balis, that
resurrects the dead?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> "Nay; ask him rather for the audrodamas which attracts silver,
iron and brass!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Oh! how I suffer! how I suffer!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Thou shalt comprehend the voices of all living creatures, the
roarings, the cooings!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "I shall enable thee to ride upon unicorns and upon
dragons, upon hippocentaurs and dolphins!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>weeping</i>). "Oh ... oh!... oh!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Thou shalt know the demons that dwell in the caverns, the
demons that mutter in the woods, the demons that move in the waves, the
demons that push the clouds!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span>. "Tighten thy girdle, fasten thy sandals!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "I shall explain to thee the reason of divine forms—why
Apollo stands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> why Jupiter is seated, why Venus is black, at Corinth,
square-shaped at Athens, conical at Paphos."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>clasping his hands</i>).</p>
<p>"Let them begone! let them begone!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "In thy presence I will tear down the panoplies of the
Gods; we shall force open the sanctuaries, I will enable thee to
violate the Pythoness!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Help! O my God!"</p>
<p>(<i>He rushes to the cross.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "What is thy desire? What is thy dream? Thou needst only
devote the moment of time necessary to think of it ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Jesus! Jesus! Help me!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Dost thou wish me to make him appear, thy Jesus?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What? How!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "It shall be He!—no other! He will cast off his crown, and
we shall converse face to face!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Damis</span> (<i>in an undertone</i>).</p>
<p>"Say thou dost indeed wish it! say thou dost desire it!"</p>
<p>(<i>Anthony kneeling before the cross, murmurs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> prayers. Damis walks
around him, with wheedling gestures.</i>)</p>
<p>"Nay, nay! good hermit. Be not horrified! These are only exaggerated
forms of speech, borrowed from the Orientals. That need in no way ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Apollonius</span>. "Let him alone, Damis!</p>
<p>"He believes, like a brute, in the reality of things. The terror which
he entertains of the Gods prevents him from comprehending them; and he
debases his own God to the level of a jealous king!</p>
<p>"But thou, my son, do not leave me!"</p>
<p>(<i>He moves to the edge of the cliff, walking backward, passes beyond
the verge of the precipice, and remains suspended in air.</i>)</p>
<p>"Above all forms, further than the ends of the earth, beyond the
heavens themselves, lies the world of Idea, replete with the splendor
of the Word! With one bound we shall traverse the impending spaces, and
thou shalt behold in all his infinity, the Eternal, the Absolute, the
Being! Come! give me thy hand! Let us rise."</p>
<p>(<i>Side by side, both rise up through the air, slowly. Anthony, clinging
to the cross, watches them rise. They disappear.</i>)</p>

<p>"That one, indeed, seems in himself equal to all the powers of Hell!</p>
<p>"Nebuchadnezzar did not so much dazzle me with his splendours;—the
Queen of Sheba herself charmed me less deeply.</p>
<p>"His manner of speaking of the gods compels one to feel a desire to
know them.</p>
<p>"I remember having beheld hundreds of them at one time, in the island
of Elephantius, in the time of Diocletian. The emperor had ceded to the
Nomads a great tract of country, upon the condition that they should
guard the frontiers; and the treaty was concluded in the name of the
'Powers Invisible.' For the gods of each people were unknown unto the
other people.</p>
<p>"The Barbarians had brought theirs with them. They occupied the
sand-hills bordering the river. We saw them supporting their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> idols in
their arms, like great paralytic children;—others, paddling through
the cataracts upon trunks of palm tree, displayed from afar off the
amulets hung about their necks, the tattooings upon their breasts; and
these things were not more sinful than the religion of the Greeks, the
Asiatics, and the Romans!</p>
<p>"When I was dwelling in the temple of Heliopolis I would often consider
the things I beheld upon the walls:—vultures bearing sceptres,
crocodiles playing upon lyres, faces of men with the bodies of
serpents, cow-headed women prostrating themselves before ithyphallic
gods:—and their supernatural forms attracted my thoughts to other
worlds. I longed to know that which drew the gaze of all those calm and
mysterious eyes.</p>
<p>"If matter can exert such power, it must surely contain a spirit. The
souls of the Gods are attached to their images ...</p>
<p>"Those possessing the beauty of forms might seduce. But the others
... those of loathsome or terrible aspect ... how can men believe in
them?..."</p>
<p>(<i>And he beholds passing over the surface of the ground,—leaves,
stones, shells,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> branches of trees,—then a variety of hydropical
dwarfs: these are gods. He bursts into a laugh. He hears another laugh
behind him;—and Hilarion appears, in the garb of a hermit, far taller
than before, colossal.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>who feels no surprise at seeing him</i>).</p>
<p>"How stupid one must be to worship such things!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Aye!—exceedingly stupid!"</p>
<p>(<i>Then idols of all nations and of all epochs—of wood, of metal, of
granite, of feathers, of skins sewn together,—pass before them.</i></p>
<p><i>The most ancient of all anterior to the Deluge are hidden under masses
of seaweed hanging down over them like manes. Some that are too long
for their bases, crack in all their joints, and break their own backs
in walking. Others have rents torn in their bellies through which sand
trickles out.</i></p>
<p><i>Anthony and Hilarion are prodigiously amused. They hold their sides
for laughter. Then appear sheep-headed idols. They totter upon their
bandy-legs, half-open their eye-lids, and stutter like the dumb,</i> "Ba!
ba! ba!"</p>
<p><i>The more that the idols commence to resemble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> the human forms, the
more they irritate Anthony. He strikes them with his fist, kicks them,
attacks them with fury. They become frightful,—with lofty plumes, eyes
like balls, fingers terminated by claws, the jaws of sharks.</i></p>
<p><i>And before these gods men are slaughtered upon altars of stone; others
are brayed alive in huge mortars, crushed under chariots, nailed upon
trees. There is one all of red-hot iron with the horns of a bull, who
devours children.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Horror!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "But the gods always demand tortures—and suffering. Even
thine desired ..."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>weeping</i>). "Ah! say no more!—do not speak to me!"</p>
<p>(<i>The space girdled by the rocks suddenly changes into a valley. A herd
of cattle are feeding upon the short grass.</i></p>
<p><i>The herdman who leads them, observes a cloud;—and in a sharp voice,
shouts out words of command, as if to heaven.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Because he needs rain, he seeks by certain chants to compel
the King of heaven to open the fecund cloud."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>
<p>"Verily, such pride is the extreme of foolishness!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Why dost thou utter exorcisms?"</p>
<p>(<i>The valley changes into a sea of milk, motionless and infinite. In
its midst floats a long cradle formed by the coils of a serpent, whose
many curving heads shade, like a dais, the god slumbering upon its
body.</i></p>
<p><i>He is beardless, young, more beautiful than a girl, and covered with
diaphanous veils. The pearls of his tiara gleam softly like moons; a
chaplet of stars is entwined many times about his breast, and with one
hand beneath his head, he slumbers with the look of one who dreams
after wine.</i></p>
<p><i>A woman crouching at his feet, awaits the moment of his awaking.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Such is the primordial duality of the Brahmans,—the
Absolute being inexpressible by any form."</p>
<p>(<i>From the navel of the god has grown the stem of a lotus flower; it
blossoms, and within its chalice appears another god with three faces.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "How strange an invention!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are but one and the same
Person!"</p>
<p>(<i>The three faces separate; and three great gods appear.</i></p>
<p><i>The first, who is pink, bites the end of his great toe.</i></p>
<p><i>The second, who is blue, uplifts his four arms.</i></p>
<p><i>The third, who is green, wears a necklace of human skulls.</i></p>
<p><i>Before them instantly arise three goddesses—one is enveloped in a
net; another offers a cup; the third brandishes a bow.</i></p>

bearing standards, axes, bucklers, swords, parasols and drums.
Fountains gush from their heads, plants grow from their nostrils.</i></p>
<p><i>Riding upon birds rocked in palanquins, enthroned upon seats of gold,
standing in ivory niches,—they dream, voyage, command, drink wine,
respire the breath of flowers. Dancing girls whirl in the dance; giants
pursue monsters; at the entrances of grottoes solitaries meditate. Eyes
cannot be distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> from stars; nor clouds from banderolles;
peacocks quench their thirst at rivers of gold dust; the embroidery
of pavilions seems to blend with the spots of leopards; coloured rays
intercross in the blue air, together with flying arrows, and swinging
censers.</i></p>
<p><i>And all this develops like a lofty frieze, resting its base upon the
rocks, and rising to the sky.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>dazzled by the sight</i>).</p>
<p>"How vast is their number! What do they seek?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "The god who rubs his abdomen with his elephant-trunk, is the
solar Deity, the inspiring spirit of wisdom.</p>
<p>"That other whose six heads are crowned with towers, and whose fourteen
arms wield javelins,—is the prince of armies,—the Fire-Consumer.</p>
<p>"The old man riding the crocodile washes the soul of the dead upon
the shore. They will be tormented by that black woman with the putrid
teeth, who is the Ruler of Hell.</p>
<p>"That chariot drawn by red mares, driven by one who has no legs, bears
the master of the sun through heaven's azure. The moon-god<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> accompanies
him, in a litter drawn by three gazelles.</p>
<p>"Kneeling upon the back of a parrot, the Goddess of Beauty presents to
Love, her son, her rounded breast. Behold her now, further off, leaping
for joy in the meadows. Look! Look! Coiffed with dazzling mitre, she
trips lightly over the ears of growing wheat, over the waves; she rises
in air, extending her power over all elements.</p>
<p>"And among these gods are the Genii of the winds, of the planets, of
the months, of the days,—a hundred thousand others;—multiple are
their aspects, rapid their transformations. Behold, there is one who
changes from a fish into a tortoise: he assumes the form of a boar, the
shape of a dwarf."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Wherefore?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "That he may preserve the equilibrium of the universe, and
combat the works of evil. But life exhausts itself; forms wear away;
and they must achieve progression in their metamorphoses."</p>
<p>(<i>All upon a sudden appears a</i> <span class="smcap">Naked Man</span> <i>seated in the midst of the

ringlets of his black hair in which blueish tints shift symmetrically
surround a protuberance upon the summit of his skull. His arms,
which are very long, hang down against his sides. His two hands rest
flat upon his thighs, with the palms open. The soles of his feet
are like the faces of two blazing suns; and he remains completely
motionless—before Anthony and Hilarion—with all the gods around him,
rising in tiers above the rocks, as if upon the benches of some vast
circus. His lips, half-open; and he speaks in a deep voice</i>):</p>
<p>"I am the Master of great charities, the succor of all creatures; and
not less to the profane than to believers, do I expound the law.</p>
<p>"That I might deliver the world, I resolved to be born among men. The
gods wept when I departed from them.</p>
<p>"I sought me first a woman worthy to give me birth: a woman of warrior
race, the wife of a king, exceedingly good, excessively beautiful,
with body firm as adamant;—and at time of the full moon, without the
auxiliation of any male, I entered her womb.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>
<p>"I issued from it by the right side. Stars stopped in their courses."</p>

the trees turned with the turning of the sun; but the shadow of that
which sheltered me turned not.</p>
<p>"None could equal me in the knowledge of the Scriptures, the
enumeration of atoms, the conduct of elephants, the working of wax,
astronomy, poetry, pugilism, all the exercises and all the arts!</p>
<p>"In accordance with custom, I took to myself a wife; and I passed the
days in my kingly palace;—clad in pearls, under a rain of perfumes,
refreshed by the fans of thirty thousand women,—watching my peoples
from the height of my terraces adorned with fringes of resonant bells.</p>
<p>"But the sight of the miseries of the world turned me away from
pleasure. I fled.</p>
<p>"I begged my way upon the high roads, clad myself in rags gathered
within the sepulchres;—and, hearing of a most learned hermit, I chose
to become his slave. I guarded his gate! I washed his feet.</p>
<p>"Thus I annihilated all sensation, all joy, all languor.</p>
<p>"Then, concentrating my thoughts within vaster meditation, I learned to
know the essence of things, the illusion of forms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>"Soon I exhausted the science of the Brahmans. They are gnawed by
covetousness and desire under their outward aspect of austerity; they
daub themselves with filth, they live upon thorns,—hoping to arrive at
happiness by the path of death!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>.... "Pharisees, hypocrites, whited sepulchres, generation of
vipers!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Buddha</span>. "I also accomplished wondrous things,—eating but one
grain of rice each day (and the grains of rice in those times were no
larger than at present)—my hair fell off; my body became black; my
eyes receding within their sockets, seemed even as stars beheld at the
bottom of a well.</p>
<p>"During six years I kept myself motionless, exposed to the flies, the
lions and the serpents; and the great summer suns, the torrential
rains, lightnings and snows, hails and tempests,—all of these I
endured without even the shelter of my lifted hand.</p>
<p>"The travellers who passed by, believing me dead, cast clods of earth
upon me!</p>

<p>"His sons came,—hideous, scale-covered, nauseous as
charnel-houses,—shrieking, hissing, bellowing; interclashing their
panoplies, rattling together the bones of dead men. Some belched
flame through their nostrils; some made darkness about me with their
wings; some wore chaplets of severed fingers; some drank serpent-venom
from the hollows of their hands;—they were swine-headed; they were
rhinoceros-headed or toad-headed; they assumed all forms that inspire
loathing or affright."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>to himself</i>).</p>
<p>"I also endured all that in other days!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Buddha.</span> "Then did he send me his daughters—beautiful with
daintily painted faces, and wearing girdles of gold. Their teeth were
whiter than the jasmine-flower; their thighs round as the trunk of
an elephant. Some extended their arms and yawned, that they might so
display the dimples of their elbows; some winked their eyes; some
laughed; some half-opened their garments. There were blushing virgins,
matrons replete with dignity, queens who came with great trains of
baggage and of slaves."</p>

in the midst of the crowd, in an avenue of cypress-trees. To right and
left are little pathways leading to huts constructed within a wood of
pomegranate trees, and enclosed by treillages of bamboo.</i></p>
<p><i>Most of the men wear pointed caps, and garments bedizened like the
plumage of a peacock. But there are also people from the North clad
in bearskins, nomads wearing mantles of brown wool, pallid Gangarides
with long earrings;—and there seems to be as much confusion of rank
as there is confusion of nations; for sailors and stone-cutters elbow
the princes who wear tiaras blazing with carbuncles and who carry
long canes with carven knobs. All proceed upon their way with dilated
nostrils, absorbed by the same desire.</i></p>
<p><i>From time to time, they draw aside to make way for some long covered

up in thick veils, who finally disappears in the direction of the

<p><i>Anthony feels afraid; he half-resolves to turn back. But an
unutterable curiosity takes possession of him, and draws him on.</i></p>
<p><i>At the foot of the cypress-trees there are ranks of women squatting
upon deerskins, all wearing in lieu of diadem, a plaited fillet of
ropes. Some, magnificently attired, loudly call upon the passers-by.
Others, more timid, seek to veil their faces with their arms, while
some matron standing behind them, their mother doubtless, exhorts
them. Others, their heads veiled with a black shawl, and their bodies
entirely nude, seem from afar off to be statues of flesh. As soon as a
man has thrown some money upon their knees, they arise.</i></p>

sharp cry.</i>)</p>

<p><i>He beholds in the air a luminous circle, poised upon horizontal
wings. This ring of light, girdles like a loose belt, the waist of a
little man wearing a mitre upon his head and carrying a wreath in his
hand. The lower part of his figure is completely concealed by immense
feathers outspreading about him like a petticoat.</i></p>

<p>"I also had mine own, the people of the stars; and from the height of
my throne I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> contemplated the marshalling of the astral hosts.</p>
<p>"Mithra, my son, dwelt in heavens inaccessible. There he received
souls, from thence did he send them forth; and he arose each morning to
pour forth the abundance of his riches.</p>
<p>"The earth reflected the splendour of the firmament. Fire blazed upon
the crests of the mountains,—symbolizing that other fire of which
I had created all creatures. And that the holy flame might not be
polluted, the bodies of the dead were not burned; the beaks of birds
carried them aloft toward heaven.</p>
<p>"I gave to men the laws regulating pastures, labour, the choice of wood
for the sacrifices, the form of cups, the words to be uttered in hours
of sleeplessness;—and my priests unceasingly offered up prayers, so
that worship might be as the eternity of God in its endlessness. Men
purified themselves with water; loaves were offered upon the altars,
sins were confessed aloud.</p>

strength communicated to them while the Genii of heaven were combating
the demons, the children of Iran were pursuing the serpents. The
King, whom an innumerable host of courtiers served upon their knees,
represented me in his person, and wore my coiffure. His gardens had the
magnificence of a heaven upon earth; and his tomb represented him in
the act of slaying a monster,—emblem of Good destroying Evil.</p>
<p>"For it was destined that I should one day definitely conquer Ahriman,
by the aid of Time-without-limits.</p>
<p>"But the interval between us disappears;—the deep night rises! To
me! ye Amschaspands, ye Izeds, ye Ferouers! Succor me, Mithra! seize
thy sword! And thou, Kaosyac, who shall return for the universal
deliverance, defend me! What!—none to aid! Ah! I die! Thou art the
victor, Ahriman!"</p>

upon her bosom; further down three rows of breasts appear; and from her
belly to her feet she is covered with a tightly fitting sheath from

her head.</i>)</p>

with a slimy foam, as though exhausted; the buzzing bees die upon the
ground.</i></p>
<p><i>She presses her breasts, one after the other. All are empty! But under
a desperate effort her sheath bursts. She seizes it by the bottom, like
the skirt of a robe, throws her animals, her fruits, her flowers, into
it,—then withdraws into the darkness.</i></p>
<p><i>And afar off there are voices, murmuring, growling, roaring,
bellowing, belling. The density of the night is augmented by breaths.
Drops of warm rain fall.</i>)</p>

reinvigorated by her eternal youth!"</p>
<p>(<i>He hears the sound of castanets and of cymbals; and men appear, clad

contributed,—eggs, grapes, pears, cheeses, fowls, little coins; and
the other basket is full of roses, which the leaders of the ass pluck
to pieces as they walk before the animal, shedding the leaves upon the
ground.</i></p>
<p><i>They wear earrings and large mantles; their locks are plaited, their
cheeks painted, olive-wreaths are fastened upon their foreheads by

<p>(<i>She utters wild lamentations.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>is filled with fury. He casts stones at her, reviles her.</i>)</p>
<p>"Begone! thou shameless one!—Begone!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Nay! respect her! Her religion was the faith of thy
fathers!—thou didst wear her amulets when thou wert a child in the
cradle!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isis</span>. "In the summers of long ago, the inundation drove the impure
beasts into the desert. The dykes were opened, the boats dashed against
each other; the panting earth drank the river with the intoxication of
joy. Then, O God, with the horns of the bull, thou didst lie upon my
breast, and then was heard, the lowings of the Eternal Cow!</p>
<p>"The seasons of sowing and reaping, of threshing and of vintage,
followed each other in regular order with the years. In the eternal
purity of the nights, broad stars beamed and glowed. The days were
bathed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> in never-varying splendour. Like a royal couple the Sun and the
Moon appeared simultaneously, at either end of the horizon.</p>
<p>"Then did we both reign above a sublimer world, twin-monarchs, wedded
within, the womb of eternity—he bearing a concupha-headed sceptre; I,
the sceptre that is tipped with a lotus-flower; both of us erect with
hands joined; and the crumblings of empires affected not our attitude.</p>
<p>"Egypt extended, below us, monumental and awful, long-shaped like the
corridor of a temple; with obelisks on the right, pyramids on the
left, and its labyrinth in the midst. And everywhere were avenues
of monsters, forests of columns, massive pylons flanking gates
summit-crowned with the mysterious globe—the globe of the world,
between two wings.</p>
<p>"The animals of her Zodiac also existed in her pasture lands; and
filled her mysterious writing with their forms and colours. Divided
into twelve regions as the year is divided into-twelve months—each
month, each day also having its own god—she reproduced the immutable
order of heaven. And man even in dying changed not his face; but
saturated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> with perfumes, invulnerable to decay, he lay down to sleep
for three thousand years in another and silent Egypt.</p>
<p>"And that Egypt, vaster than the Egypt of the living, extended beneath
the earth.</p>
<p>"Thither one descended by dark stairways leading into halls where were
represented the joys of the good, the tortures of the wicked, all that
passes in the third and invisible world. Ranged along the wall the dead
in their painted coffins awaited their turn; and the soul, exempted
from migrations, continued its heavy slumber until the awakening into a
new life.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, Osiris sometimes came to see me. And by his ghost I
became the mother of Harpocrates."</p>
<p>(<i>She contemplates the child.</i>)</p>
<p>"Aye! it is he. Those are his eyes; those are his locks, plaited into
ram horns! Thou shalt recommence his works. We shall bloom again like
the lotus. I am still the Great Isis!—none has yet lifted my veil! My

abundantly.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "What makes thee sorrowful?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>after having long sought within himself for a reply</i>):</p>
<p>"I think of all the souls that have been lost through these false gods!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Dost thou not think that they ... sometimes ... bear much
resemblance to the <span class="smcap">True</span>?"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "That is but a device of the Devil to seduce the faithful more
easily. He attacks the strong through the mind, the weak through the
flesh."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "But luxury, in its greatest fury, has all the
disinterestedness of penitence. The frenzied love of the body
accelerates the destruction thereof,—and proclaims the extent of the
impossible by the exposition of the body's weakness."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "What signifies that to me! My heart sickens with disgust
of these beautiful bestial gods, forever busied with carnages and
incests!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "Yet recollect all those things in the Scripture which
scandalize thee because thou art unable to comprehend them! So also may
these Gods conceal under their sinful forms some mighty truth. There
are more of them yet to be seen. Look around!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "But a little while ago thou didst desire to know them! Is
it because thy faith might vacillate in the presence of lies? What
fearest thou?"</p>
<p>(<i>The rocks fronting Anthony have become as a mountain. A line of
clouds obscures the mountain half way between summit and base; and
above the clouds appears another mountain, enormous, all green,
unequally hollowed by valleys nestling in its slopes, and supporting at
its summit, in the midst of laurel-groves a palace of bronze, roofed
with tiles of gold, and supported by columns having capitals of ivory.</i></p>
<p><i>In the centre of the peristyle Jupiter,—colossal, with torso
nude,—holds Victory in one hand, his thunderbolts in the other; and
his eagle, perched between his feet, rears its head.</i></p>

her wind-blown veil escapes like a vapour.</i></p>
<p><i>Behind them, Minerva, standing upon a pedestal, leans on her spear.
The skin of the Gorgon covers her breast, and a linen peplos falls in
regular folds to the nails of her toes. Her glaucous eyes, which gleam
beneath her vizor, gaze afar off, attentively.</i></p>
<p><i>On the right of the palace, the aged Neptune bestrides a dolphin
beating with its fins a vast azure expanse which may be sea or sky, for
the perspective of the Ocean seems a continuation of the blue ether:
the two elements are interblended.</i></p>
<p><i>On the other side weird Pluto in night-black mantle, crowned with
diamond tiara and bearing a sceptre of ebony, sits in the midst of an
islet surrounded by the circumvolutions of the Styx;—and this river of
shadow empties itself into the darknesses, which form a vast black gulf
below the cliff,—a bottomless abyss!</i></p>
<p><i>Mars, clad in brass, brandishes as in wrath his broad shield and his
sword.</i></p>
<p><i>Hercules, leaning upon his club, gazes at him from below.</i></p>
<p><i>Apollo, his face ablaze with light, grasps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> with outstretched right
arm the reins of four white horses urged to a gallop; and Ceres in her
ox-drawn chariot advances toward him with a sickle in her hand.</i></p>
<p><i>Behind her comes Bacchus, riding in a very low chariot, gently drawn
by lynxes. Plump and beardless, with vine leaves garlanding his brow,
he passes by holding in his hand an overflowing cup of wine. Silenus
riding beside him reels upon his ass. Pan of the pointed ears, blows
upon his syrinx; the Mimalonæides beat drums; the Mænads strew
flowers; the Bacchantes turn in the dance with heads thrown back and
hair dishevelled.</i></p>
<p><i>Diana, with tunic tucked up, issues from the wood together with her
nymphs.</i></p>
<p><i>At the further end of a cavern, Vulcan among his Cabiri, hammers the
heated iron; here and there the aged Rivers leaning recumbent upon
green rocks pour water from their urns; the Muses stand singing in the
valleys</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Hours, all of equal stature, link hands; and Mercury poses
obliquely upon a rainbow, with his caduceus, winged sandals, and winged
petasus.</i></p>
<p><i>But at the summit of the stairway of the Gods,—among clouds soft
as down, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> whose turning volutes a rain of roses falls,—Venus
Anadyomene stands gazing at herself in a mirror:—her eyes move
languorously beneath their slumbrous lids.</i></p>
<p><i>She has masses of rich blond hair rolling down over her shoulders; her
breasts are small; her waist is slender; her hips curve out like the
sweeping curves of a lyre; her thighs are perfectly rounded; there are
dimples about her knees; her feet are delicate: a butterfly hovers near
her mouth. The splendour of her body makes a nacreous-tinted halo of
bright light about her; while all the rest of Olympus is bathed in a
pink dawn, rising gradually to the heights of the blue sky.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. "Ah! my heart swells! A joy never known before thrills me to
the depths of my soul! How beautiful, how beautiful it is!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>. "They leaned from the heights of cloud to direct the way of
swords; one used to meet them upon the high roads; men had them in
their houses—and this familiarity divinized life.</p>
<p>"Life's aim was only to be free and beautiful. Nobility of attitude was
facilitated by the looseness of garments. The voice of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> orator,
trained by the sea, rolled its sonorous waves against the porticoes of
marble. The ephebus, anointed with oil, wrestled all naked in the full
light of the sun. The holiest of actions was to expose perfection of
forms to all.</p>
<p>"And these men respected wives, aged men, suppliants.</p>
<p>"Behind the temple of Hercules there was an altar erected to Pity.</p>
<p>"Victims were immolated with flowers wreathed about the fingers of the
sacrificer. Even memory was exempted from thoughts of the rottenness
of death. Nothing remained but a little pile of ashes. And the Soul,
mingling with the boundless ether, rose up to God."</p>
<p>(<i>Bending to whisper in Anthony's ear</i>:—)</p>
<p>"And they still live! The Emperor Constantine adores Apollo. Thou wilt
find the Trinity in Samothracian mysteries,—baptism in the religion of
Isis,—redemption in the faith of Mithra,—a martyrdom of a God in the
festivals of Bacchus. Prosperpine is the Virgin!... Aristæus is Jesus!"</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>remains awhile with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought;

it, uttering a long sigh between each phrase</i>):—</p>
<p>"I believe in one only God, the Father,—and in one only Lord, Jesus
Christ,—the first born son of God, who was incarnated and made
man,—who was crucified, and buried,—who ascended into Heaven,—who
will come to judge the living and the dead,—of whose Kingdom there
shall be no end;—and in one Holy Spirit,—and in one baptism of
repentance,—and in one Holy Catholic Church,—and in the resurrection
of the flesh,—and in the life everlasting!"</p>
<p>(<i>Immediately the cross becomes loftier and loftier; it pierces the
clouds, and casts its shadow upon the heaven of the gods.</i></p>
<p><i>All grow pale;—Olympus shudders.</i></p>
<p><i>And at its base Anthony beholds vast bodies enchained, sustaining the
rocks upon their shoulders,—giant figures half buried in the deeps
of caverns. These are the Titans, the Giants, the Hecatonchires, the
Cyclops.</i>)</p>
<p class="smcap" style="text-align: center;">A Voice</p>

<p>"We knew these things!—we knew them! There must come an end even for
the Gods! Uranus was mutilated by Saturn,—Saturn by Jupiter. And
Jupiter himself shall be annihilated. Each in his turn;—it is Destiny!"</p>

fleeing from the Campus Martins, dost thou bear me the soul of the last

the guidance of their magistrates and priests. Then, all in white robes
and wearing chitons of gold, they advanced the long line of virgins
bearing cups, baskets, parasols; then the three hundred sacrificial
oxen, and the old men having green boughs, the soldiers with clashing
of armour, the ephebi singing hymns, flute players, lyre players,
rhapsodists, dancing women;—and lastly attached to the mast of a
trireme mounted upon wheel, my great veil embroidered by virgins who
had been nourished in a particular way for a whole year. And when it
had been displayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> in all the streets, in all the squares, and before
the temples, in the midst of the ever-chanting procession, it was borne

called the swine together by sound of horn,—those who were wont to
gather the bunches at the very summits of the elms,—those who drove
the asses, laden with manure, over the winding bypaths. The panting
labourer, leaning over the handle of his plough, prayed them to give
strength to his arms; and under the shade of the lindens, beside

they can.</i>)</p>
<p>"Where is the portion of food we received at each repast, the kindly
care of the maid-servant, the smile of the matron, the merriment of
the little boys playing at knuckle-bones on the mosaic pavement of the
court-yard? When grown up, they used to hang about our necks their
bullæ of gold or leather!</p>
<p>"What happiness it was, when on the evening of a triumph, the master,
entering, turned his humid eyes upon us! He would recount his combats;
and the little house would be prouder than a palace; sacred as a temple!</p>
<p>"How sweet were the family repasts, above all on the morrow of the
Feralia! Tenderness for the dead appeased all discords; all kissed each
other, while drinking to the glories of the past, and the hopes of the
future.</p>

chosen people in their flight.</p>
<p>"It was I who consumed the city of Sodom with fire! It was I who
overwhelmed the world with the waters of the Deluge! It was I that
drowned Pharaoh, with all the princes, sons of Kings,—making the sea
to swallow up his chariots of war, and his charioteers!</p>
<p>"I, the Jealous God, held all other gods in abomination. I brayed the
impure in my anger; the mighty I cast down; and swiftly the desolation
of my wrath ran to the right and to the left, like a dromedary loosened
in a field of maize.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>"I chose the humble to deliver Israel. Angels, flame-winged, spake to
them from out the bushes.</p>
<p>"Perfumed with spikenard, with cinnamon and myrrh, clad in transparent
robes, and shod with high-heeled sandals,—women of valiant heart went
forth to slay captains. The passing wind carried my prophets with it.</p>
<p>"My law I graved upon tables of stone. Within that law my people were
enclosed, as within a strong citadel. They were my people. I was their
God! The land was mine; the men also belonged to me, together with
their every thought, and all their works, and the tools they wrought
with, and their prosperity.</p>
<p>"My ark reposed within a triple sanctuary,—surrounded by curtains
of purple and lighted candelabra. I had a whole tribe to serve me as
servants, swinging censers; and the high-priest, robed in robes of
hyacinth, wore upon his breast precious stones disposed in symmetrical
order.</p>
<p>"Woe! Woe! the Holy of Holies is open, the veil is rent, the perfumes
of the holocaust are dissipated by all the winds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> heaven! The jackal
whines in the sepulchres; my temple is destroyed; my people dispersed!</p>
<p>"The priests have been strangled with the girdles of their robes. The
women languish in captivity; the holy vessels have all been melted!"</p>

nothingness!"</p>

medium of thy mind. Even as a concave mirror, it deforms the objects
it reflects; and thou hast no means whatever of verifying their
exactitude."</p>

it will never be possible for thee to obtain an idea of its cause,
to have a just notion of God, nor even to say that the universe is
infinite,—for thou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> must first be able to know what the Infinite is!"</p>

intolerable to me! My heart is dry as a rock! Once, it was wont to
overflow with love!...</p>
<p>"The sand used to smoke of mornings like the odourous dust of a
censer;—at sunset flowers of fire used to bloom upon the cross; and in
the middle of the night, it often seemed as though all beings and all
things, lying under the same awful silence, were adoring the Lord with
me. O charms of prayer, felicities of ecstasy, gifts of heaven,—what
have become of you?</p>
<p>"I remember a voyage I made with Ammon in search of a solitary place
suited for the establishment of a monastery. It was the last evening;
we hastened our steps, walked side by side, murmuring hymns, without
conversing. As the sun sank, the shadows of our bodies lengthened like
two obelisks, continually growing taller, and moving before us. Here
and there we planted crosses, made with fragments of our sticks, to
mark the site of a future cell. Night was tardy in her coming; and
waves of darkness overspread the earth, even while a vast rose-coloured
light still glowed in heaven.</p>
<p>"When I was a child, I used to amuse myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> by building hermitages
with pebbles. My mother sitting beside me would watch me so attentively!</p>
<p>"Will she not have cursed me for having abandoned her?—will she not
have plucked out her white hair by handfuls in the despair of her
grief? And her corpse remains lying on the floor of the hut, under the
roof of reeds, between the crumbling walls. Through an orifice a hyena,
snuffing, thrusts his head, advances his mouth ... horror! horror!"</p>
<p>(<i>Sobbing</i>):</p>
<p>"No: Ammonaria will not have abandoned her! Where is she
now,—Ammonaria?</p>
<p>"Perhaps at the further end of a bathroom, she removes her garments
one after the other: first the mantle, then the girdle, then the first
tunic, the second lighter tunic, all her necklaces,—and the vapour
of cinnamon envelops her naked limbs. At last she lies down upon the
tepid mosaic. Her long hair spreading below the curve of her hips,
seems like a sable fleece; and the oppressiveness of the heated air
causes her to pant; her waist arched, her breasts standing out ...
What! my flesh rebels again! Even in the midst of grief am I tortured
by concupiscence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> To be subjected thus unto two tortures at once is
beyond endurance! I can no longer bear myself!"</p>

necessary to roll over upon my left side:—only one movement—one!"</p>
<p>(<i>Then suddenly appears</i>—<span class="smcap">An Aged Woman</span>. <i>Anthony starts to his feet in
affright. It seems to him that he beholds his mother arisen.</i></p>
<p><i>But this woman is far older, and prodigiously thin.</i></p>
<p><i>A shroud, knotted about her head, hangs down, together with her white
hair, so as to cover her legs, slender as crutches. The brilliancy of
her ivory-coloured teeth make her earthy skin darker still. The orbits
of her eyes are full of shadow; and far back within them two flames
vacillate, like the lamps of sepulchres.</i></p>

<p>"But King Saul killed himself! Razias, a just man, killed himself!
Saint Pelagia of Antioch killed herself! Dommina of Aleppo and her two
daughters—all three saints—killed themselves: and remember also how
many confessors delivered themselves up to the executioner in their
impatient longing for death! That they might enjoy death more speedily,
the virgins of Miletus strangled themselves with their girdles. At
Syracuse the philosopher Hegesias preached so eloquently upon death
that men deserted the lupanars to go hang themselves in the fields. The
patricians of Borne sought for death as a new form of debauch."</p>

not?—in the wood by the light of the moon? At each pressure of your
joined hands, a sweet shuddering passes through you both,—looking

with which English readers have been familiarized through the Bohn

the following lines in Suetonius: "<i>Dicitur etiam meditatus edictum,

cum periclitatum quemdam prae pudore ex continentia reperisset.</i>"

<p><a id="Footnote_2_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_30" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The so-called divinities, <i>Deus Crepitus, Dea Pertunda,
Deus Stercutius, Dea Rumina</i> (or <i>Rumilia</i>), <i>Dea Mena</i>, concerning
whose curious attributes the reader may consult English or French
classical encyclopedists, were doubtless regarded by the intelligent
classes of antiquity much as certain religious superstitions are
regarded by educated moderns. It is true that they furnished grotesque
themes to artists; but many existing superstitions regarding elves
and goblins have inspired modern sculptors, painters and designers.
Certainly, seriously worshipped as deities, Priapus might seem equally
contemptible as a divinity; but his worship, degenerate as it became
in later years, was primitively symbolical. The obscene image merely
typified the procreative Spirit of Nature. The eccentric gods and
goddesses above referred to had no such excuse for being. As previously
observed, however, Flaubert artistically represents these divinities
not as they were really considered in the antique world, but rather as
they would have appeared to the eyes of zealous Christians in the third
century—infamous and loathsome.—Translator.</p></div>

This translation of the "Tentation" by Lafcadio Hearn, still regarded
by many as the best up until now in English, still misses some small
fragments (of a couple of words) not deemed fit for the Anglo-Saxon
temperament of that time. There is a contemporary version (2002) of
this translation available, with introduction by Michel Foucault and
the inclusion of some missing expressions. The original French by
Gustave Flaubert is also available at Project Gutenberg—

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
