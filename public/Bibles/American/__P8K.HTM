<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RP href="__P8K.HTM#$RP">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the four hundred and eightieth year from
the departure of the Israelites from the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of
Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month,
the construction of the temple of the LORD was begun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The temple which King Solomon built for the
LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty wide, and twenty-five high. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The porch in front of the temple was twenty
cubits from side to side, along the width of the nave, and ten cubits deep in
front of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Splayed windows with trellises were made for
the temple, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and adjoining the wall of the temple, which
enclosed the nave and the sanctuary, an annex of several stories was built. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Its lowest story was five cubits wide, the
middle one six cubits wide, the third seven cubits wide, because there were
offsets along the outside of the temple so that the beams would not be fastened
into the walls of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The temple was built of stone dressed at the
quarry, so that no hammer, axe, or iron tool was to be heard in the temple
during its construction.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The entrance to the lowest floor of the annex
was at the right side of the temple, and stairs with intermediate landings led
up to the middle story and from the middle story to the third. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the temple was built to its full height,
it was roofed in with rafters and boards of cedar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The annex, with its lowest story five cubits
high, was built all along the outside of the temple, to which it was joined by
cedar beams. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RQ href="__P8K.HTM#$RQ">2</a></sup></font></sup> This word of the LORD came to Solomon: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;As to this temple you are building - if
you observe my statutes, carry out my ordinances, keep and obey all my
commands, I will fulfill toward you the promise I made to your father David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will dwell in the midst of the Israelites and
will not forsake my people Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Solomon finished building the temple, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>its walls were lined from floor to ceiling
beams with cedar paneling, and its floor was laid with fir planking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the rear of the temple a space of twenty
cubits was set off by cedar partitions from the floor to the rafters, enclosing
the sanctuary, the holy of holies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The nave, or part of the temple in front of the
sanctuary, was forty cubits long. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cedar in the interior of the temple was
carved in the form of gourds and open flowers; all was of cedar, and no stone
was to be seen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RR href="__P8K.HTM#$RR">3</a></sup></font></sup> In the innermost part of the temple was
located the sanctuary to house the ark of the LORD'S covenant, </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RS href="__P8K.HTM#$RS">4</a></sup></font></sup> twenty cubits long, twenty wide, and twenty
high. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon overlaid the interior of the temple
with pure gold. He made in front of the sanctuary a cedar altar, overlaid it
with gold, and looped it with golden chains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The entire temple was overlaid with gold so
that it was completely covered with it; the whole altar before the sanctuary
was also overlaid with gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the sanctuary were two cherubim, each ten
cubits high, made of olive wood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each wing of a cherub measured five cubits so
that the space from wing tip to wing tip of each was ten cubits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cherubim were identical in size and shape, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and each was exactly ten cubits high. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cherubim were placed in the inmost part of
the temple, with their wings spread wide, so that one wing of each cherub touched
a side wall while the other wing, pointing toward the middle of the room,
touched the corresponding wing of the second cherub. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cherubim, too, were overlaid with gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The walls on all sides of both the inner and
the outer rooms had carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The floor of both the inner and the outer rooms
was overlaid with gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the entrance of the sanctuary, doors of
olive wood were made; the doorframes had beveled posts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The two doors were of olive wood, with carved
figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. The doors were overlaid with
gold, which was also molded to the cherubim and the palm trees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The same was done at the entrance to the nave,
where the doorposts of olive wood were rectangular. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The two doors were of fir wood; each door was
banded by a metal strap, front and back, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and had carved cherubim, palm trees, and open
flowers, over which gold was evenly applied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The inner court was walled off by means of
three courses of hewn stones and one course of cedar beams. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The foundations of the LORD'S temple were laid
in the month of Ziv </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in the fourth year, and it was completed in all
particulars, exactly according to plan, in the month of Bul, the eighth month,
in the eleventh year. Thus it took Solomon seven years to build it. </p>
