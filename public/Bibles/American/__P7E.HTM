<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David fled from the sheds near Ramah, and went
to Jonathan. &quot;What have I done?&quot; he asked him. &quot;What crime or
what offense does your father hold against me that he seeks my life?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan answered him: &quot;Heaven forbid that
you should die! My father does nothing, great or small, without disclosing it
to me. Why, then, should my father conceal this from me? This cannot be
so!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David replied: &quot;Your father is well
aware that I am favored with your friendship, so he has decided, 'Jonathan must
not know of this lest he be grieved.' Nevertheless, as the LORD lives and as
you live, there is but a step between me and death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan then said to David, &quot;I will do
whatever you wish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David answered: &quot;Tomorrow is the new moon,
when I should in fact dine with the king. Let me go and hide in the open
country until evening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If it turns out that your father misses me,
say, 'David urged me to let him go on short notice to his city Bethlehem,
because his whole clan is holding its seasonal sacrifice there.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he says, 'Very well,' your servant is safe.
But if he becomes quite angry, you can be sure he has planned some harm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do this kindness for your servant because of
the LORD'S bond between us, into which you brought me: if I am guilty, kill me
yourself! Why should you give me up to your father?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jonathan answered: &quot;Not I! If ever I
find out that my father is determined to inflict injury upon you, I will
certainly let you know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then asked Jonathan, &quot;Who will tell
me if your father gives you a harsh answer?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Jonathan replied to David, &quot;Come, let us
go out into the field.&quot; When they were out in the open country together, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan said to David: &quot;As the LORD, the
God of Israel, lives, I will sound out my father about this time tomorrow.
Whether he is well disposed toward David or not, I will send you the
information. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Should it please my father to bring any injury
upon you, may the LORD do thus and so to Jonathan if I do not apprise you of it
and send you on your way in peace. May the LORD be with you even as he was with
my father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only this: if I am still alive, may you show me
the kindness of the LORD. But if I die, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>never withdraw your kindness from my house. And
when the LORD exterminates all the enemies of David from the surface of the
earth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the name of Jonathan must never be allowed by
the family of David to die out from among you, or the LORD will make you answer
for it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And in his love for David, Jonathan renewed his
oath to him, because he loved him as his very self.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan then said to him: &quot;Tomorrow is
the new moon; and you will be missed, since your place will be vacant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the following day you will be missed all the
more. Go to the spot where you hid on the other occasion and wait near the
mound there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the third day of the month I will shoot
arrows, as though aiming at a target. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will then send my attendant to go and recover
the arrows. If in fact I say to him, 'Look, the arrow is this side of you; pick
it up,' come, for you are safe. As the LORD lives, there will be nothing to
fear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrow is
beyond you,' go, for the LORD sends you away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, in the matter which you and I have
discussed, the LORD shall be between you and me forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David hid in the open country. On the day of
the new moon, when the king sat at table to dine, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>taking his usual place against the wall,
Jonathan sat facing him, while Abner sat at the king's side, and David's place
was vacant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q2 href="__P7E.HTM#$Q2">1</a></sup></font></sup> Saul, however, said nothing that day, for he
thought, &quot;He must have become unclean by accident, and not yet have been
cleansed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the next day, the second day of the month,
David's place was vacant. Saul inquired of his son Jonathan, &quot;Why has the
son of Jesse not come to table yesterday or today?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan answered Saul: &quot;David urgently
asked me to let him go to his city, Bethlehem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Please let me go,' he begged, 'for we are to
have a clan sacrifice in our city, and my brothers insist on my presence. Now,
therefore, if you think well of me, give me leave to visit my brothers.' That
is why he has not come to the king's table.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Saul was extremely angry with Jonathan and
said to him: &quot;Son of a rebellious woman, do I not know that, to your own
shame and to the disclosure of your mother's shame, you are the companion of
Jesse's son? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why, as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the
earth, you cannot make good your claim to the kingship! So send for him, and
bring him to me, for he is doomed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jonathan asked his father Saul: &quot;Why
should he die? What has he done?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this Saul brandished his spear to strike
him, and thus Jonathan learned that his father was resolved to kill David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger
and took no food that second day of the month, for he was grieved on David's
account, since his father had railed against him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next morning Jonathan went out into the
field with a little boy for his appointment with David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There he said to the boy, &quot;Run and fetch
the arrow.&quot; And as the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him in the
direction of the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the boy made for the spot where Jonathan
had shot the arrow, Jonathan called after him, &quot;The arrow is farther
on!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again he called to his lad, &quot;Hurry, be
quick, don't delay!&quot; Jonathan's boy picked up the arrow and brought it to
his master. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The boy knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew
what was meant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to this boy of
his and said to him, &quot;Go, take them to the city.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the boy had left, David rose from beside
the mound and prostrated himself on the ground three times before Jonathan in
homage. They kissed each other and wept aloud together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At length Jonathan said to David, &quot;Go in
peace, in keeping with what we two have sworn by the name of the LORD: 'The
LORD shall be between you and me, and between your posterity and mine
forever.'&quot; </p>
