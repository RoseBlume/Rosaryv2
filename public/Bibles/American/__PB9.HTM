<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 25</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother, named
Jehoaddan, was from Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did what was pleasing in the sight of the
LORD, though not wholeheartedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After he had strengthened his hold on the
kingdom, he slew those of his servants who had killed the king, his father; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but he did not put their children to death, for
he acted according to what is written in the law, in the Book of Moses, as the
LORD commanded: &quot;Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor
children for their fathers; but only for his own guilt shall a man be put to
death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah mustered Judah and placed them, out of
all Judah and Benjamin according to their ancestral houses, under leaders of
thousands and of hundreds. When he had counted those of twenty years and over,
he found them to be three hundred thousand picked men fit for war, capable of
handling lance and shield. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also hired a hundred thousand valiant
warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But a man of God came to him and said: &quot;O
king, let not the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel,
with any Ephraimite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead, go on your own, strongly prepared for
the conflict; otherwise the LORD will defeat you in the face of the enemy. It
is God who has the power to reinforce or to defeat.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah answered the man of God, &quot;But what
is to be done about the hundred talents that I paid for the troops of
Israel?&quot; The man of God replied, &quot;The LORD can give you much more
than that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah then disbanded the troops that had come
to him from Ephraim, and sent them home. They, however, became furiously angry
with Judah, and returned home blazing with resentment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah now assumed command of his army. They
proceeded to the Valley of Salt, and there they killed ten thousand men of
Seir. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Judahites also brought back another ten
thousand alive, whom they led to the summit of the Rock and then cast down, so
that they were all crushed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, the mercenaries whom Amaziah had
dismissed from battle service with him raided the cities of Judah from Samaria
to Beth-horon. They killed three thousand of the inhabitants and took away much
booty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Amaziah returned from his conquest of the
Edomites he brought back with him the gods of the people of Seir, which he set
up as his own gods; he bowed down before them and offered sacrifice to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the anger of the LORD blazed out against
Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him who said: &quot;Why have you had recourse
to this people's gods that could not save their own people from your
hand?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While he was still speaking, however, the king
said to him: &quot;Have you been made the king's counselor? Be silent! Why
should it be necessary to kill you?&quot; Therefore the prophet desisted.
&quot;I know, however,&quot; he said, &quot;that God has let you take counsel
to your own destruction, because you have done this thing and have refused to hear
my counsel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Having taken counsel, King Amaziah of Judah
sent messengers to Joash, son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, the king of Israel,
saying, &quot;Come, let us meet each other face to face.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Joash of Israel sent this reply to King
Amaziah of Judah: &quot;The thistle of the Lebanon sent a message to the cedar
of the Lebanon, saying, 'Give your daughter to my son for his wife.' But the
wild beasts of the Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You are thinking, 'See, I have beaten Edom!',
and thus ambition makes you proud. Remain at home. Why involve yourself, and
Judah with you, in misfortune and failure?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Amaziah would not listen, for God had
determined to hand them over because they had had recourse to the gods of Edom.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore King Joash of Israel advanced and he
and King Amaziah met in battle at Beth-shemesh of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There Judah was defeated by Israel, and all the
Judean soldiers fled homeward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Joash of Israel captured Amaziah, king of
Judah, son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh and brought him to
Jerusalem. Then he tore down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the
Corner Gate, a distance of four hundred cubits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WW href="__PB9.HTM#$WW">1</a></sup></font></sup> He took away all the gold and silver and all
the vessels he found in the house of God with Obed-edom, together with the
treasures of the palace, and hostages as well. Then he returned to Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, survived
Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, by fifteen years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last,
can be found written, as is well known, in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now from the time that Amaziah ceased to follow
the LORD, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem; hence he fled to
Lachish. But they pursued him to Lachish and put him to death there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WX href="__PB9.HTM#$WX">2</a></sup></font></sup> They brought him back on horses and buried him
with his ancestors in the City of Judah. </p>
