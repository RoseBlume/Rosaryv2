<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 23</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David received information that the Philistines
were attacking Keilah and plundering the threshing floors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he consulted the LORD, inquiring,
&quot;Shall I go and defeat these Philistines?&quot; The LORD answered,
&quot;Go, for you will defeat the Philistines and rescue Keilah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David's men said to him: &quot;We are
afraid here in Judah. How much more so if we go to Keilah against the forces of
the Philistines!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again David consulted the LORD, who answered,
&quot;Go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your
power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then went with his men to Keilah and
fought with the Philistines. He drove off their cattle and inflicted a severe
defeat on them, and thus rescued the inhabitants of Keilah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, who had fled to
David, went down with David to Keilah, taking the ephod with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Saul was told that David had entered
Keilah, he said: &quot;God has put him in my grip. Now he has shut himself in,
for he has entered a city with gates and bars.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then called all the people to war, in
order to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David found out that Saul was planning to
harm him, he said to the priest Abiathar, &quot;Bring forward the ephod.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then said: &quot;O LORD God of Israel,
your servant has heard a report that Saul plans to come to Keilah, to destroy the
city on my account. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Will they hand me over? And now: will Saul come
down as your servant has heard? O LORD God of Israel, tell your servant.&quot;
The LORD answered, &quot;He will come down.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then asked, &quot;Will the citizens of
Keilah deliver me and my men into the grasp of Saul?&quot; And the LORD
answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David and his men, about six hundred in
number, left Keilah and wandered from place to place. When Saul was informed
that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned the expedition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David now lived in the refuges in the desert,
or in the barren hill country near Ziph. Though Saul sought him continually,
the LORD did not deliver David into his grasp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David was apprehensive because Saul had come
out to seek his life; but while he was at Horesh in the barrens near Ziph, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul's son, Jonathan, came down there to David
and strengthened his resolve in the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to him: &quot;Have no fear, my father
Saul shall not lay a hand to you. You shall be king of Israel and I shall be
second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They made a joint agreement before the LORD in
Horesh, where David remained, while Jonathan returned to his home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some of the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gibeah
and said, &quot;David is hiding among us, now in the refuges, and again at
Horesh, or on the hill of Hachilah, south of the wasteland. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, whenever the king wishes to come
down, let him do so. It will be our task to deliver him into the king's
grasp.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul replied: &quot;The LORD bless you for your
sympathy toward me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Go now and make sure once more! Take note of
the place where he sets foot&quot; (for he thought, perhaps they are playing
some trick on me). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Look around and learn in which of all the
various hiding places he is holding out. Then come back to me with sure
information, and I will go with you. If he is in the region, I will search him
out among all the families of Judah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they went off to Ziph ahead of Saul. At this
time David and his men were in the desert below Maon, in the Arabah south of
the wasteland. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Saul and his men came looking for him,
David got word of it and went down to the gorge in the desert below Maon. Saul
heard of this and pursued David into the desert below Maon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Saul moved along one rim of the gorge, David
and his men took to the other. David was in anxious flight to escape Saul, and
Saul and his men were attempting to outflank David and his men in order to
capture them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when a messenger came to Saul, saying,
&quot;Come quickly, because the Philistines have invaded the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul interrupted his pursuit of David and went
to meet the Philistines. This is how that place came to be called the Gorge of
Divisions. </p>
