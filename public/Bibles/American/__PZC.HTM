virgin is anxious about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both

questions addressed to him by the Corinthians (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor
7:1-<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 11:1). The first of these concerns
marriage. This chapter contains advice both to the married (1-16) and to the
unmarried (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:25-38) or widowed
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.39"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:39-40); these two parts are separated by
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:17-24, which enunciate a principle

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4B1 href="__PZC.HTM#-4B1">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [1-16] It seems that some
Christians in Corinth were advocating asceticism in sexual matters. The pattern
it is a good thing . . . , but occurs twice (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor
7:1-2, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 8-9; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor
7:26), suggesting that in this matter as in others the Corinthians
have seized upon a genuine value but are exaggerating or distorting it in some
way. Once again Paul calls them to a more correct perspective and a better
sense of their own limitations. The phrase it is a good thing
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:1) may have been the slogan of the
ascetic party at Corinth.</p>

behavior (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:7-8) suggest that his celibate
way of life and his preaching to the unmarried (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor
7:25-35) have given some the impression that asceticism within marriage,
i.e., suspension of normal sexual relations, would be a laudable ideal. Paul
points to their experience of widespread immorality to caution them against
overestimating their own strength (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:2); as
individuals they may not have the particular gift that makes such asceticism
feasible (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:7) and hence are to abide by the

of the term charisma suggests that marriage and celibacy may be viewed in the
light of Paul's theology of spiritual gifts (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4B5 href="__PZC.HTM#-4B5">6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [8] Paul was obviously unmarried
when he wrote this verse. Some interpreters believe that he had previously been
married and widowed; there is no clear evidence either for or against this
view, which was expressed already at the end of the second century by Clement
of Alexandria.</p>

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWC.HTM#GOSP.MAR.10.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 10:9). This is one of his rare specific

which only one partner is a baptized Christian. Jesus' prohibition against
divorce is not addressed to them, but Paul extends the principle of
nonseparation to such unions, provided they are marked by peacefulness and
shared sanctification.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4B8 href="__PZC.HTM#-4B8">9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [15-16] If the unbeliever

human conditions are less significant than the whole new existence opened up by
God's call, Paul urges them to be less concerned with changing their states of life
than with answering God's call where it finds them. The principle applies both
to the married state (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:1-16) and to the

that the principle of <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:17 does not bind
under sin but that present earthly conditions make it advantageous for the
unmarried to remain as they are (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:28).
These remarks must be complemented by the statement about &quot;particular
gifts&quot; from <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 7:7.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4BC href="__PZC.HTM#-4BC">13</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [36-38] The passage is difficult to
interpret, because it is unclear whether Paul is thinking of a father and his
unmarried daughter (or slave), or of a couple engaged in a betrothal or
spiritual marriage. The general principles already enunciated apply: there is
no question of sin, even if they should marry, but staying as they are is
&quot;better&quot; (for the reasons mentioned in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZC.HTM#NTLET.1COR.7.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor
