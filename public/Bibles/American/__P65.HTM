<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>An angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to
Bochim and said, &quot;It was I who brought you up from Egypt and led you into
the land which I promised on oath to your fathers. I said that I would never
break my covenant with you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but that you were not to make a pact with the
inhabitants of this land, and you were to pull down their altars. Yet you have
not obeyed me. What did you mean by this? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For now I tell you, I will not clear them out
of your way; they shall oppose you and their gods shall become a snare for
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the angel of the LORD had made these
threats to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MG href="__P65.HTM#$MG">1</a></sup></font></sup> and so that place came to be called Bochim.
They offered sacrifice there to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joshua dismissed the people, each
Israelite went to take possession of his own hereditary land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people served the LORD during the entire
lifetime of Joshua, and of those elders who outlived Joshua and who had seen
all the great work which the LORD had done for Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of the LORD,
was a hundred and ten years old when he died; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and they buried him within the borders of his
heritage at Timnath-heres in the mountain region of Ephraim north of Mount
Gaash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But once the rest of that generation were
gathered to their fathers, and a later generation arose that did not know the
LORD, or what he had done for Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MH href="__P65.HTM#$MH">2</a></sup></font></sup> the Israelites offended the LORD by serving
the Baals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abandoning the LORD, the God of their fathers,
who had led them out of the land of Egypt, they followed the other gods of the
various nations around them, and by their worship of these gods provoked the
LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MI href="__P65.HTM#$MI">3</a></sup></font></sup> Because they had thus abandoned him and served
Baal and the Ashtaroth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the anger of the LORD flared up against Israel,
and he delivered them over to plunderers who despoiled them. He allowed them to
fall into the power of their enemies round about whom they were no longer able
to withstand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whatever they undertook, the LORD turned into
disaster for them, as in his warning he had sworn he would do, till they were in
great distress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even when the LORD raised up judges to deliver
them from the power of their despoilers, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they did not listen to their judges, but
abandoned themselves to the worship of other gods. They were quick to stray
from the way their fathers had taken, and did not follow their example of
obedience to the commandments of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, he
would be with the judge and save them from the power of their enemies as long
as the judge lived; it was thus the LORD took pity on their distressful cries
of affliction under their oppressors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the judge died, they would relapse and
do worse than their fathers, following other gods in service and worship,
relinquishing none of their evil practices or stubborn conduct. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In his anger toward Israel the LORD said,
&quot;Inasmuch as this nation has violated my covenant which I enjoined on
their fathers, and has disobeyed me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I for my part will not clear away for them any
more of the nations which Joshua left when he died.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Through these nations the Israelites were to be
made to prove whether or not they would keep to the way of the LORD and
continue in it as their fathers had done; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>therefore the LORD allowed them to remain
instead of expelling them immediately, or delivering them into the power of
Israel. </p>
