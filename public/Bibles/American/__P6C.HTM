<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abimelech, son of Jerubbaal, went to his mother's
kinsmen in Shechem, and said to them and to the whole clan to which his
mother's family belonged, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Put this question to all the citizens of
Shechem: 'Which is better for you: that seventy men, or all Jerubbaal's sons, rule
over you, or that one man rule over you?' You must remember that I am your own
flesh and bone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his mother's kin repeated these words to
them on his behalf, all the citizens of Shechem sympathized with Abimelech,
thinking, &quot;He is our kinsman.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also gave him seventy silver shekels from
the temple of Baal of Berith, with which Abimelech hired shiftless men and
ruffians as his followers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then went to his ancestral house in Ophrah,
and slew his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. Only the
youngest son of Jerubbaal, Jotham, escaped, for he was hidden. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the citizens of Shechem and all
Beth-millo came together and proceeded to make Abimelech king by the terebinth
at the memorial pillar in Shechem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this was reported to him, Jotham went to
the top of Mount Gerizim, and standing there, cried out to them in a loud
voice: &quot;Hear me, citizens of Shechem, that God may then hear you! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once the trees went to anoint a king over
themselves. So they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N2 href="__P6C.HTM#$N2">1</a></sup></font></sup> But the olive tree answered them, 'Must I give
up my rich oil, whereby men and gods are honored, and go to wave over the
trees?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come; you
reign over us!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the fig tree answered them, 'Must I give up
my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the trees said to the vine, 'Come you, and
reign over us.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N3 href="__P6C.HTM#$N3">2</a></sup></font></sup> But the vine answered them, 'Must I give up my
wine that cheers gods and men, and go to wave over the trees?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the trees said to the buckthorn,
'Come; you reign over us!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the buckthorn replied to the trees, 'If you
wish to anoint me king over you in good faith, come and take refuge in my
shadow. Otherwise, let fire come from the buckthorn and devour the cedars of
Lebanon.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N4 href="__P6C.HTM#$N4">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Now then, if you have acted in good
faith and honorably in appointing Abimelech your king, if you have dealt well
with Jerubbaal and with his family, and if you have treated him as he deserved
-&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for my father fought for you at the risk of his
life when he saved you from the power of Midian; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but you have risen against his family this day
and have killed his seventy sons upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the
son of his handmaid, king over the citizens of Shechem, because he is your
kinsman -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>if, then, you have acted in good faith and with
honor toward Jerubbaal and his family this day, rejoice in Abimelech and may he
in turn rejoice in you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if not, let fire come forth from Abimelech
to devour the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo, and let fire come forth from
the citizens and from Beth-millo to devour Abimelech.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jotham went in flight to Beer, where he
remained for fear of his brother Abimelech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Abimelech had ruled Israel for three
years, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God put bad feelings between Abimelech and the
citizens of Shechem, who rebelled against Abimelech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This was to repay the violence done to the
seventy sons of Jerubbaal and to avenge their blood upon their brother
Abimelech, who killed them, and upon the citizens of Shechem, who encouraged
him to kill his brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The citizens of Shechem then set men in ambush
for him on the mountaintops, and these robbed all who passed them on the road.
But it was reported to Abimelech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Gaal, son of Ebed, came over to Shechem
with his kinsmen. The citizens of Shechem put their trust in him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and went out into the fields, harvested their
grapes and trod them out. Then they held a festival and went to the temple of
their god, where they ate and drank and cursed Abimelech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gaal, son of Ebed, said, &quot;Who is
Abimelech? And why should we of Shechem serve him? Were not the son of
Jerubbaal and his lieutenant Zebul once subject to the men of Hamor, father of
Shechem? Why should we serve him? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Would that this people were entrusted to my
command! I would depose Abimelech. I would say to Abimelech, 'Get a larger army
and come out!'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the news of what Gaal, son of Ebed, had
said, Zebul, the ruler of the city, was angry </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and sent messengers to Abimelech in Arumah with
the information: &quot;Gaal, son of Ebed, and his kinsmen have come to Shechem
and are stirring up the city against you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now rouse yourself; set an ambush tonight in
the fields, you and the men who are with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Promptly at sunrise tomorrow morning, make a
raid on the city. When he and his followers come out against you, deal with him
as best you can.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During the night Abimelech advanced with all
his soldiers and set up an ambush for Shechem in four companies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gaal, son of Ebed, went out and stood at the
entrance of the city gate. When Abimelech and his soldiers rose from their
place of ambush, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gaal saw them and said to Zebul, &quot;There
are men coming down from the hilltops!&quot; But Zebul answered him, &quot;You
see the shadow of the hills as men.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Gaal went on to say, &quot;Men are coming
down from the region of Tabbur-Haares, and one company is coming by way of
Elon-Meonenim.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zebul said to him, &quot;Where now is the boast
you uttered, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Are these not the men
for whom you expressed contempt? Go out now and fight with them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Gaal went out at the head of the citizens of
Shechem and fought against Abimelech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Abimelech routed him, and he fled before
him; and many fell slain right up to the entrance of the gate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abimelech returned to Arumah, but Zebul drove
Gaal and his kinsmen from Shechem, which they had occupied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day, when the people were taking the
field, it was reported to Abimelech, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who divided the men he had into three
companies, and set up an ambush in the fields. He watched till he saw the
people leave the city, and then rose against them for the attack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abimelech and the company with him dashed in
and stood by the entrance of the city gate, while the other two companies
rushed upon all who were in the field and attacked them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N5 href="__P6C.HTM#$N5">4</a></sup></font></sup> That entire day Abimelech fought against the
city, and captured it. He then killed its inhabitants and demolished the city,
sowing the site with salt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard of this, all the citizens of
Migdal-shechem went into the crypt of the temple of El-berith. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was reported to Abimelech that all the
citizens of Migdal-shechem were gathered together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went up Mount Zalmon with all his
soldiers, took his axe in his hand, and cut down some brushwood. This he lifted
to his shoulder, then said to the men with him, &quot;Hurry! Do just as you
have seen me do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So all the men likewise cut down brushwood, and
following Abimelech, placed it against the crypt. Then they set the crypt on
fire over their heads, so that every one of the citizens of Migdal-shechem,
about a thousand men and women, perished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abimelech proceeded to Thebez, which he
invested and captured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now there was a strong tower in the middle of
the city, and all the men and women, in a word all the citizens of the city,
fled there, shutting themselves in and going up to the roof of the tower. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abimelech came up to the tower and fought
against it, advancing to the very entrance of the tower to set it on fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But a certain woman cast the upper part of a
millstone down on Abimelech's head, and it fractured his skull. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He immediately called his armor-bearer and said
to him, &quot;Draw your sword and dispatch me, lest they say of me that a woman
killed me.&quot; So his attendant ran him through and he died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was
dead, they all left for their homes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus did God requite the evil Abimelech had
done to his father in killing his seventy brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God also brought all their wickedness home to
the Shechemites, for the curse of Jotham, son of Jerubbaal, overtook them. </p>
