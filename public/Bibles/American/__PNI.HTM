<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>The Prophetic Books</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
prophetic books bear the names of the four major and twelve minor prophets,
besides Lamentations and Baruch. The terms &quot;major&quot; and
&quot;minor&quot; refer merely to the length of the respective compositions and
not to any distinction in the prophetic office. Jonah is a story of the mission
of the prophet rather than a collection of prophecies. Lamentations and Daniel
are listed among the hagiographa in the Hebrew Bible, not among the prophetic
books. The former contains a series of elegies on the fate of Jerusalem; the
latter is apocalyptic in character. Daniel, who lived far removed from
Palestine, was not called by God to preach; yet the book is counted as
prophecy. Baruch, though excluded from the Hebrew canon, is found in the
Septuagint version, and the Church has always acknowledged it to be sacred and
inspired. </p>

<p>The prophetic books,
together with the oral preaching of the prophets, were the result of the
institution of prophetism, in which a succession of Israelites chosen by God
and appointed by him to be prophets received communications from him and
transmitted them to the people in his name (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4X.HTM#PENT.DEU.18.15"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut
18:15-20). The prophets were spokesmen of God intermediaries between
him and his people. The communications they received from God came through
visions, dreams, and ecstasies and were transmitted to the people through
sermons, writings, and symbolic actions.</p>

<p>The office of prophet was
due to a direct call from God. It was not the result of heredity, just as it
was not a permanent gift but a transient one, subject entirely to the divine
will. The prophets preserved and developed revealed religion
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P76.HTM#HIS.1SAM.12.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Sam 12:6-25), denounced idolatry
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8S.HTM#HIS.1KIN.14.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 14:1-13), defended the moral law
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P81.HTM#HIS.2SAM.12.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Sam 12:1-15), gave counsel in political
matters (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_POE.HTM#PROPHB.ISA.31.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah 31:1-3), and often also in matters
of private life (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P73.HTM#HIS.1SAM.9.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Sam 9:6-9). At times miracles
confirmed their preaching, and their predictions of the future intensified the
expectation of the Messiah and of his kingdom.</p>

<p>The prophetic literature in
this volume contains the substance of the prophets' authentic preaching,
resumes, and genuine samples of such preaching. Some parts were recorded by the
prophets themselves, some by persons other than the prophets who uttered them.</p>

<p>The prophecies express
judgments of the people's moral conduct, on the basis of the Mosaic alliance
between God and Israel. They teach sublime truths and lofty morals. They
contain exhortations, threats, announcements of punishment, promises of
deliverance, made with solemn authority and in highly imaginative language. In
the affairs of men, their prime concern is the interests of God, especially in
what pertains to the chosen people through whom the Messiah is to come; hence
their denunciations of idolatry and of that externalism in worship which
excludes the interior spirit of religion. They are concerned also with the
universal nature of the moral law, with personal responsibility, with the person
and office of the Messiah, and with the conduct of foreign nations.</p>

<p>In content, the literary
genre of prophecy uses warning and threat besides exhortation and promise to
declare in God's name events of the near and distant future (Isa 8-9). In form,
the divine source of prophetic declaration appears in: &quot;The word (or
oracle) of the Lord,&quot; or &quot;Thus says the LORD,&quot; followed by the
announcement of a coming event and its moral cause (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PT4.HTM#PROPHB.HOS.4.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hosea
4:7-10). Divine exhortation and promise are introduced by such forms
as: &quot;Hear this word, O men of Israel, that the LORD pronounces over
you&quot; (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PTN.HTM#PROPHB.AMO.3.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Amos 3:1). Kindly and persuasive tones
pervade the promises of reward and even the threats of punishment (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PTP.HTM#PROPHB.AMO.5.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Amos
5:14-15).</p>

<p>Disregard for exact
chronological perspective in the prophecies is an additional characteristic.</p>

<p>Predictions of the
immediate and distant future are often interrelated, not on the basis of years
separating the events but on the analogy of the pattern joining present with
very distant, though similar, conditions and circumstances. This is prophetic
compenetration, idealization in which persons and things of the more immediate
present, in the prophet's day, fade into a wider and more perfect order of
persons and things of the future; the former are figures and types of the
latter. Thus, some details of what the Psalmist said of the kingdom of David
and Solomon (Psa 72) went beyond what was fulfilled in these men, as St. Thomas
points out, and found their realization only in the kingdom of Christ. St.
Jerome before him, and still earlier the apostles themselves-Peter
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXW.HTM#GOSP.ACT.2.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 2:14-36) and Paul (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P104.HTM#NTLET.GAL.4.21"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal
4:21-31)-taught us that through anticipation in types we discover in
Sacred Scripture the truth of things to come.</p>

<p>Thus the universal blessing
for mankind, often promised by God through the mouths of his prophets in
figures and types, was in time to become personalized and to confer its full
benefit on us through the Word made flesh, who became for us the New Covenant
through his life, death, and resurrection, as the prophets had
foretold.</p>
