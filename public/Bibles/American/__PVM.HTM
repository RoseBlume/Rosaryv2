the third great discourse of Jesus in Matthew and constitutes the second part
of the third book of the gospel. Matthew follows the Marcan outline
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW6.HTM#GOSP.MAR.4.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 4:1-35) but has only two of Mark's parables,
the five others being from Q and M. In addition to the seven parables, the
discourse gives the reason why Jesus uses this type of speech (Matthew 10-15),
declares the blessedness of those who understand his teaching (Matthew 16-17),
explains the parable of the sower (Matthew 18-23) and of the weeds (Matthew
36-43), and ends with a concluding statement to the disciples (Matthew 51-52). </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$31O href="__PVM.HTM#-31O">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3-8] Since in Palestine sowing
often preceded ploughing, much of the seed is scattered on ground that is unsuitable.
Yet while much is wasted, the seed that falls on good ground bears fruit in
extraordinarily large measure. The point of the parable is that, in spite of
some failure because of opposition and indifference, the message of Jesus about
the coming of the kingdom will have enormous success.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$31P href="__PVM.HTM#-31P">3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3] In parables: the word
&quot;parable&quot; (Greek parabole) is used in the LXX to translate the Hebrew
mashal, a designation covering a wide variety of literary forms such as axioms,
proverbs, similitudes, and allegories. In the New Testament the same breadth of
meaning of the word is found, but there it primarily designates stories that
are illustrative comparisons between Christian truths and events of everyday
life. Sometimes the event has a strange element that is quite different from
usual experience (e.g., in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVM.HTM#GOSP.MAT.13.33"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:33 the
enormous amount of dough in the parable of the yeast); this is meant to sharpen
the curiosity of the hearer. If each detail of such a story is given a figurative
meaning, the story is an allegory. Those who maintain a sharp distinction
between parable and allegory insist that a parable has only one point of
comparison, and that while parables were characteristic of Jesus' teaching, to
see allegorical details in them is to introduce meanings that go beyond their
original intention and even falsify it. However, to exclude any allegorical
elements from a parable is an excessively rigid mode of interpretation, now
abandoned by many scholars.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$31Q href="__PVM.HTM#-31Q">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [11] Since a parable is figurative
speech that demands reflection for understanding, only those who are prepared
to explore its meaning can come to know it. To understand is a gift of God,
granted to the disciples but not to the crowds. In Semitic fashion, both the
disciples' understanding and the crowd's obtuseness are attributed to God. The
question of human responsibility for the obtuseness is not dealt with, although
it is asserted in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVM.HTM#GOSP.MAT.13.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:13. The mysteries:
as in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWR.HTM#GOSP.LUK.8.10"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 8:10; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW6.HTM#GOSP.MAR.4.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
4:11 has &quot;the mystery.&quot; The word is used in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSN.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.2.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 2:18, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSN.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.2.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 19,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSN.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.2.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 27 and in the Qumran literature (1QpHab 7:8; 1QS
3:23; 1QM 3:9) to designate a divine plan or decree affecting the course of
history that can be known only when revealed. Knowledge of the mysteries of the
kingdom of heaven means recognition that the kingdom has become present in the
ministry of Jesus.</p>

of the parable the emphasis is on the various types of soil on which the seed
falls, i.e., on the dispositions with which the preaching of Jesus is received.
The second and third types particularly are explained in such a way as to
support the view held by many scholars that the explanation derives not from
Jesus but from early Christian reflection upon apostasy from the faith that was
the consequence of persecution and worldliness respectively. Others, however,
hold that the explanation may come basically from Jesus even though it was
developed in the light of later Christian experience. The four types of persons
envisaged are (1) those who never accept the word of the kingdom
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVM.HTM#GOSP.MAT.13.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 13:19); (2) those who believe for a

mean that the kingdom of heaven may be likened simply to the person in question
but to the situation narrated in the whole story. The refusal of the
householder to allow his slaves to separate the wheat from the weeds while they
are still growing is a warning to the disciples not to attempt to anticipate
the final judgment of God by a definitive exclusion of sinners from the
kingdom. In its present stage it is composed of the good and the bad. The
judgment of God alone will eliminate the sinful. Until then there must be
patience and the preaching of repentance.</p>

they have to acquire these finds; similarly, the one who understands the
supreme value of the kingdom gives up whatever he must to obtain it. The joy
with which this is done is made explicit in the first parable, but it may be
presumed in the second also. The concluding parable of the fishnet resembles
the explanation of the parable of the weeds with its stress upon the final
exclusion of evil persons from the kingdom.</p>

scribe cannot be taken as applicable to all who accept the message of Jesus.
While the Twelve are in many ways representative of all who believe in him,
they are also distinguished from them in certain respects. The church of
Matthew has leaders among whom are a group designated as &quot;scribes&quot;
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVW.HTM#GOSP.MAT.23.34"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 23:34). Like the scribes of Israel, they
are teachers. It is the Twelve and these their later counterparts to whom this
verse applies. The scribe . . . instructed in the kingdom of heaven knows both
the teaching of Jesus (the new) and the law and prophets (the old) and provides
in his own teaching both the new and the old as interpreted and fulfilled by
the new. On the translation head of a household (for the same Greek word
