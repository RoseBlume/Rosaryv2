participants (Antiquities 18, 4, 1 #86-87), and that on another occasion Pilate
had killed many Jews who had opposed him when he appropriated money from the

when punishment will be meted out, and the importance of preparing for the end
of the age because the delay will not be permanent (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWW.HTM#GOSP.LUK.13.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke

not remain open indefinitely (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWW.HTM#GOSP.LUK.13.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 13:25). Lying

contemporaries (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWW.HTM#GOSP.LUK.13.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 13:26) whose places at table
