<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-22N href="__PNH.HTM#$22N">1</a></sup></font></sup> I give you thanks, O God of my father; I
praise you, O God my savior! I will make known your name, refuge of my life; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you have been my helper against my adversaries.
You have saved me from death, and kept back my body from the pit, From the
clutches of the nether world you have snatched my feet; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you have delivered me, in your great mercy From
the scourge of a slanderous tongue, and from lips that went over to falsehood;
From the snare of those who watched for my downfall, and from the power of
those who sought my life; From many a danger you have saved me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>from flames that hemmed me in on every side;
From the midst of unremitting fire, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the deep belly of the nether world; From
deceiving lips and painters of lies, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>from the arrows of dishonest tongues. I was at
the point of death, my soul was nearing the depths of the nether world; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I turned every way, but there was no one to help
me, I looked for one to sustain me, but could find no one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But then I remembered the mercies of the LORD,
his kindness through ages past; For he saves those who take refuge in him, and
rescues them from every evil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So I raised my voice from the very earth, from
the gates of the nether world, my cry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I called out: O Lord, you are my father, you
are my champion and my savior; Do not abandon me in time of trouble, in the
midst of storms and dangers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will ever praise your name and be constant in
my prayers to you. Thereupon the LORD heard my voice, he listened to my appeal;

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She came to me in her beauty, and until the end
I will cultivate her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the blossoms yielded to ripening grapes, the
heart's joy, My feet kept to the level path because from earliest youth I was
familiar with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the short time I paid heed, I met with great
instruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since in this way I have profited, I will give
my teacher grateful praise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I became resolutely devoted to her -&nbsp; the good I persistently strove for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I burned with desire for her, never turning
back. I became preoccupied with her, never weary of extolling her. My hand
opened her gate and I came to know her secrets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For her I purified my hands; in cleanness I
attained to her. At first acquaintance with her, I gained understanding such
that I will never forsake her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My whole being was stirred as I learned about
her; therefore I have made her my prize possession. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD has granted me my lips as a reward,
and my tongue will declare his praises. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come aside to me, you untutored, and take up
lodging in the house of instruction; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How long will you be deprived of wisdom's food,
how long will you endure such bitter thirst? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I open my mouth and speak of her: gain, at no
cost, wisdom for yourselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Submit your neck to her yoke, that your mind
may accept her teaching. For she is close to those who seek her, and the one
who is in earnest finds her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See for yourselves! I have labored only a
little, but have found much. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Acquire but a little instruction; you will win
silver and gold through her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let your spirits rejoice in the mercy of God,
and be not ashamed to give him praise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Work at your tasks in due season, and in his
own time God will give you your reward. </p>

text gives the litany of praise contained below. It is similar to Psalm 136.
Though not found in any versions, and therefore of doubtful authenticity, the
litany seems from internal evidence to go back to the time of Sirach:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Give thanks
to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to the
God of glory, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to the guardian of
Israel, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to the creator of the
universe, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to the redeemer of Israel,
for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to him who gathers the dispersed of
Israel, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to him who builds his city
and his sanctuary, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks to him who makes
a horn to sprout forth for the house of David, for his mercy endures forever;
Give thanks to him who has chosen for his priests the sons of Zadok, for his
mercy endures forever; Give thanks to the shield of Abraham, for his mercy
endures forever; Give thanks to the rock of Isaac, for his mercy endures forever;
Give thanks to the mighty one of Jacob, for his mercy endures forever; Give
thanks to him who has chosen Zion, for his mercy endures forever; Give thanks
to the king over kings of kings, for his mercy endures forever. He has lifted
up the horn of his people, be this his praise from all his faithful ones, From
the children of Israel, the people close to him. Alleluia! (Cf
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PJW.HTM#WISDB.PSA.148.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm 148:14.) </p>

instruction (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNH.HTM#WISDB.SIR.51.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach 51:13-17), purification from

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNH.HTM#WISDB.SIR.51.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach 51:18-22). The author concludes with an
urgent invitation to men to receive instruction in wisdom from him, and to live
by it, because wisdom gives herself to those who seek her
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNH.HTM#WISDB.SIR.51.23"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach 51:23-26); and for their labor, God will
