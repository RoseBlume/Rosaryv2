<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now a rebellious individual from Benjamin named
Sheba, the son of Bichri, happened to be there. He sounded the horn and cried
out, &quot;We have no portion in David, nor any share in the son of Jesse.
Every man to his tent, O Israel!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So all the Israelites left David for Sheba, son
of Bichri. But from the Jordan to Jerusalem the Judahites remained loyal to
their king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When King David came to his palace in
Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines whom he had left behind to take care of
the palace and placed them in confinement. He provided for them, but had no
further relations with them. And so they remained in confinement to the day of
their death, lifelong widows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said to Amasa: &quot;Summon the
Judahites for me within three days. Then present yourself here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly Amasa set out to summon Judah, but
delayed beyond the time set for him by David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to Abishai: &quot;Sheba, son of
Bichri, may now do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord's servants and
pursue him, lest he find fortified cities and take shelter while we look
on.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Joab and the Cherethites and Pelethites and
all the warriors marched out behind Abishai from Jerusalem to campaign in
pursuit of Sheba, son of Bichri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-R0 href="__P89.HTM#$R0">1</a></sup></font></sup> They were at the great stone in Gibeon when
Amasa met them. Now Joab had a belt over his tunic, from which was slung, in
its sheath near his thigh, a sword that could be drawn with a downward
movement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Joab asked Amasa, &quot;How are you, my
brother?&quot; With his right hand Joab held Amasa's beard as if to kiss him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And since Amasa was not on his guard against
the sword in Joab's other hand, Joab stabbed him in the abdomen with it, so
that his entrails burst forth to the ground, and he died without receiving a
second thrust. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba, son of Bichri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of Joab's attendants stood by Amasa and
said, &quot;Let him who favors Joab and is for David follow Joab.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amasa lay covered with blood in the middle of
the highroad, and the man noticed that all the soldiers were stopping. So he
removed Amasa from the road to the field and placed a garment over him, because
all who came up to him were stopping. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had been removed from the road,
everyone went on after Joab in pursuit of Sheba, son of Bichri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel
to Abel Beth-maacah. Then all the Bichrites assembled and they too entered the
city after him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David's servants came and besieged him in
Abel Beth-maacah. They threw up a mound against the city, and all the soldiers
who were with Joab began battering the wall to throw it down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then a wise woman from the city stood on the
outworks and called out, &quot;Listen, listen! Tell Joab to come here, that I
may speak with him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joab had come near her, the woman said,
&quot;Are you Joab?&quot; And he replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; She said to him,
&quot;Listen to what your maidservant has to say.&quot; He replied. &quot;I am
listening.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-R1 href="__P89.HTM#$R1">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then she went on to say: &quot;There is an
ancient saying, 'Let them ask if they will in Abel </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>or in Dan whether loyalty is finished or ended
in Israel.' You are seeking to beat down a city that is a mother in Israel. Why
do you wish to destroy the inheritance of the LORD?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab answered, &quot;Not at all, not at all! I
do not wish to destroy or to ruin anything. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That is not the case at all. A man named Sheba,
son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim has rebelled against King
David. Surrender him alone, and I will withdraw from the city.&quot; Then the
woman said to Joab, &quot;His head shall be thrown to you across the
wall.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She went to all the people with her advice, and
they cut off the head of Sheba, son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He
then sounded the horn, and they scattered from the city to their own tents,
while Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab was in command of the whole army of
Israel. Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was in command of the Cherethites and
Pelethites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Adoram was in charge of the forced labor.
Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, was the chancellor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shawsha was the scribe. Zadok and Abiathar were
priests. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ira the Jairite was also David's priest. </p>
