<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then had all the elders of Judah and
of Jerusalem summoned together before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king went up to the temple of the LORD with
all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: priests, prophets,
and all the people, small and great. He had the entire contents of the book of
the covenant that had been found in the temple of the LORD, read out to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Standing by the column, the king made a covenant
before the LORD that they would follow him and observe his ordinances, statutes
and decrees with their whole hearts and souls, thus reviving the terms of the
covenant which were written in this book. And all the people stood as
participants in the covenant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king commanded the high priest
Hilkiah, his vicar, and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD
all the objects that had been made for Baal, Asherah, and the whole host of
heaven. He had these burned outside Jerusalem on the slopes of the Kidron and
their ashes carried to Bethel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also put an end to the pseudo-priests whom
the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense on the high places in the
cities of Judah and in the vicinity of Jerusalem, as well as those who burned
incense to Baal, to the sun, moon, and signs of the Zodiac, and to the whole
host of heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the temple of the LORD he also removed the
sacred pole, to the Kidron Valley, outside Jerusalem; there he had it burned
and beaten to dust, which was then scattered over the common graveyard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-U6 href="__P9N.HTM#$U6">1</a></sup></font></sup> He tore down the apartments of the cult
prostitutes which were in the temple of the LORD, and in which the women wove
garments for the Asherah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He brought in all the priests from the cities
of Judah, and then defiled, from Geba to Beer-sheba, the high places where they
had offered incense. He also tore down the high place of the satyrs, which was
at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua, governor of the city, to the left as one
enters the city gate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priests of the high places could not
function at the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem; but they, along with their
relatives, ate the unleavened bread. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-U7 href="__P9N.HTM#$U7">2</a></sup></font></sup> The king also defiled Topheth in the Valley of
Ben-hinnom,
so that there would no longer be an immolation of sons or daughters by fire in
honor of Molech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-U8 href="__P9N.HTM#$U8">3</a></sup></font></sup> He did away with the horses which the kings of
Judah had dedicated to the sun; these were at the entrance of the temple of the
LORD, near the chamber of Nathan-melech the eunuch, which was in the large
building. The chariots of the sun he destroyed by fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also demolished the altars made by the kings
of Judah on the roof (the roof terrace of Ahaz), and the altars made by
Manasseh in the two courts of the temple of the LORD. He pulverized them and
threw the dust into the Kidron Valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-U9 href="__P9N.HTM#$U9">4</a></sup></font></sup> The king defiled the high places east of
Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Misconduct, which Solomon, king of Israel, had
built in honor of Astarte, the Sidonian horror, of Chemosh, the Moabite horror,
and of Milcom, the idol of the Ammonites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He broke to pieces the pillars, cut down the
sacred poles, and filled the places where they had been with human bones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Likewise the altar which was at Bethel, the
high place built by Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin - this
same altar and high place he tore down, breaking up the stones and grinding
them to powder, and burning the Asherah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Josiah turned and saw the graves there on
the mountainside, he ordered the bones taken from the graves and burned on the
altar, and thus defiled it in fulfillment of the word of the LORD which the man
of God had proclaimed as Jeroboam was standing by the altar on the feast day.
When the king looked up and saw the grave of the man of God who had proclaimed
these words, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he asked, &quot;What is that tombstone I
see?&quot; The men of the city replied, &quot;It is the grave of the man of God
who came from Judah and predicted the very things you have done to the altar of
Bethel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UA href="__P9N.HTM#$UA">5</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Let him be,&quot; he said, &quot;let no
one move his bones.&quot; So they left his bones undisturbed together with the
bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Josiah also removed all the shrines on the high
places near the cities of Samaria which the kings of Israel had erected,
thereby provoking the LORD; he did the very same to them as he had done in
Bethel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He slaughtered upon the altars all the priests
of the high places that were at the shrines, and burned human bones upon them.
Then he returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king issued a command to all the people to
observe the Passover of the LORD, their God, as it was prescribed in that book
of the covenant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No Passover such as this had been observed
during the period when the Judges ruled Israel, or during the entire period of
the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>until the eighteenth year of king Josiah, when
this Passover of the LORD was kept in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UB href="__P9N.HTM#$UB">6</a></sup></font></sup> Further, Josiah did away with the consultation
of ghosts and spirits, with the household gods, idols, and all the other
horrors to be seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he might
carry out the stipulations of the law written in the book that the priest
Hilkiah had found in the temple of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Before him there had been no king who turned to
the LORD as he did, with his whole heart, his whole soul, and his whole
strength, in accord with the entire law of Moses; nor could any after him
compare with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet, because of all the provocations that
Manasseh had given, the LORD did not desist from his fiercely burning anger
against Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said: &quot;Even Judah will I put out
of my sight as I did Israel. I will reject this city, Jerusalem, which I chose,
and the temple of which I said, 'There shall my name be.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Josiah, with all that
he did, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In his time Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went
up toward the river Euphrates to the king of Assyria. King Josiah set out to
confront him, but was slain at Megiddo at the first encounter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UC href="__P9N.HTM#$UC">7</a></sup></font></sup> His servants brought his body on a chariot
from Megiddo to Jerusalem, where they buried him in his own grave. Then the
people of the land took Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, anointed him, and proclaimed
him king to succeed his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother, whose
name was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah, was from Libnah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
his forebears had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UD href="__P9N.HTM#$UD">8</a></sup></font></sup> Pharaoh Neco took him prisoner at Riblah in
the land of Hamath, thus ending his reign in Jerusalem. He imposed a fine upon
the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh Neco then appointed Eliakim, son of
Josiah, king in place of his father Josiah; he changed his name to Jehoiakim.
Jehoahaz he took away with him to Egypt, where he died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh,
but taxed the land to raise the amount Pharaoh demanded. He exacted the silver
and gold from the people of the land, from each proportionately, to pay Pharaoh
Neco. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Zebidah, daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah. </p>
