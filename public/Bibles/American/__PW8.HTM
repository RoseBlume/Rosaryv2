<p class=MsoNormal>6

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was amazed at their lack of faith. He went
around to the villages in the vicinity teaching. </p>

him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Herod feared John, knowing him to be a
righteous and holy man, and kept him in custody. When he heard him speak he was
very much perplexed, yet he liked to listen to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21

his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers, his military officers, and the
leading men of Galilee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Herodias's own daughter came in and performed a
dance that delighted Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, &quot;Ask
of me whatever you wish and I will grant it to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He even swore (many things) to her, &quot;I

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The girl hurried back to the king's presence
and made her request, &quot;I want you to give me at once on a platter the head
of John the Baptist.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king was deeply distressed, but because of
his oaths and the guests he did not wish to break his word to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he promptly dispatched an executioner with
orders to bring back his head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his
heart was moved with pity for them, for they were like sheep without a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He asked them, &quot;How many loaves do you
have? Go and see.&quot; And when they had found out they said, &quot;Five
loaves and two fish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he gave orders to have them sit down in

came toward them walking on the sea. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3EH href="__PW8.HTM#$3EH">22</a></sup></font></sup> He meant to pass by

contrary to Jewish custom, which calls a man the son of his father, this

usage, the terms &quot;brother,&quot; &quot;sister&quot; are applied not only
to children of the same parents, but to nephews, nieces, cousins,

should be sought in the first place from Semitic usage, the Septuagint often
translates the Hebrew ah by the Greek word adelphos, &quot;brother,&quot; as in
the cited passages, a fact that may argue for a similar breadth of meaning in
some New Testament passages. For instance, there is no doubt that in v 17,
&quot;brother&quot; is used of Philip, who was actually the half-brother of
Herod Antipas. On the other hand, Mark may have understood the terms literally;
