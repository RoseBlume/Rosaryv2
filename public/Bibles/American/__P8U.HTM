<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 16</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD spoke against Baasha to Jehu, son of
Hanani, and said: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Inasmuch as I lifted you up from the dust
and made you ruler of my people Israel, but you have imitated the conduct of Jeroboam
and have caused my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger by their sins, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will destroy you, Baasha, and your house; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will make your house like that of Jeroboam,
son of Nebat. If anyone of Baasha's line dies in the city, dogs shall devour
him; if he dies in the field, he shall be devoured by the birds of the
sky.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Baasha, with all his
valor and accomplishments, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Baasha rested with his ancestors; he was buried
in Tirzah, and his son Elah succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Through the prophet Jehu, son of Hanani, the
LORD had threatened Baasha and his house, because of all the evil Baasha did in
the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger by his evil deeds, so that he
became like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed Nadab.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa, king of Judah,
Elah, son of Baasha, began his two-year reign over Israel in Tirzah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servant Zimri, commander of half his
chariots, plotted against him. As he was in Tirzah, drinking to excess in the
house of Arza, superintendent of his palace in Tirzah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zimri entered; he struck and killed him in the
twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of Judah, and reigned in his place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once he was seated on the royal throne, he
killed off the whole house of Baasha, not sparing a single male relative or
friend of his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zimri destroyed the entire house of Baasha, as
the LORD had prophesied to Baasha through the prophet Jehu, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because of all the sins which Baasha and his
son Elah committed and caused Israel to commit, provoking the LORD, the God of
Israel, to anger by their idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Elah, with all that he
did, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa, king of
Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. The army was besieging Gibbethon of
the Philistines </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when they heard that Zimri had formed a
conspiracy and had killed the king. So that day in the camp all Israel
proclaimed Omri, general of the army, king of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Omri marched up from Gibbethon, accompanied by
all Israel, and laid siege to Tirzah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Zimri saw the city was captured, he
entered the citadel of the royal palace and burned down the palace over him. He
died </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because of the sins he had committed, doing
evil in the sight of the LORD by imitating the sinful conduct of Jeroboam, thus
causing Israel to sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Zimri, with the
conspiracy he carried out, are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time the people of Israel were divided,
half following Tibni, son of Ginath, to make him king, and half for Omri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The partisans of Omri prevailed over those of
Tibni, son of Ginath. Tibni died and Omri became king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the thirty-first year of Asa, king of Judah,
Omri became king; he reigned over Israel twelve years, the first six of them in
Tirzah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer
for two silver talents and built upon the hill, naming the city he built
Samaria after Shemer, the former owner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Omri did evil in the LORD'S sight beyond
any of his predecessors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He closely imitated the sinful conduct of
Jeroboam, son of Nebat, causing Israel to sin and to provoke the LORD, the God
of Israel, to anger by their idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Omri, with all his
valor and accomplishments, are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Omri rested with his ancestors; he was buried
in Samaria, and his son Ahab succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa, king of
Judah, Ahab, son of Omri, became king of Israel; he reigned over Israel in
Samaria for twenty-two years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab, son of Omri, did evil in the sight of the
LORD more than any of his predecessors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was not enough for him to imitate the sins
of Jeroboam, son of Nebat. He even married Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king
of the Sidonians, and went over to the veneration and worship of Baal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab erected an altar to Baal in the temple of
Baal which he built in Samaria, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and also made a sacred pole. He did more to
anger the LORD, the God of Israel, than any of the kings of Israel before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During his reign, Hiel from Bethel rebuilt
Jericho. He lost his first-born son, Abiram, when he laid the foundation, and
his youngest son, Segub, when he set up the gates, as the LORD had foretold
through Joshua, son of Nun. </p>
