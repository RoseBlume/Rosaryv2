<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahithophel went on to say to Absalom:
&quot;Please let me choose twelve thousand men, and be off in pursuit of David
tonight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If I come upon him when he is weary and
discouraged, I shall cause him panic. When all the people with him flee, I
shall strike down the king alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I can bring back the rest of the people to
you, as a bride returns to her husband. It is the death of only one man you are
seeking; then all the people will be at peace.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This plan was agreeable to Absalom and to all
the elders of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Absalom said, &quot;Now call Hushai the
Archite also; let us hear what he too has to say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to
him: &quot;This is what Ahithophel proposed. Shall we follow his proposal? If
not, speak up.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hushai replied to Absalom, &quot;This time
Ahithophel has not given good counsel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he went on to say: &quot;You know that your
father and his men are warriors, and that they are as fierce as a bear in the
wild robbed of her cubs. Moreover, since your father is skilled in warfare, he
will not spend the night with the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even now he lies hidden in one of the caves or
in some other place. And if some of our soldiers should fall at the first
attack, whoever hears of it will say, 'Absalom's followers have been
slaughtered.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then even the brave man with the heart of a
lion will lose courage. For all Israel knows that your father is a warrior and
that those who are with him are brave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This is what I counsel: Let all Israel
from Dan to Beer-sheba, who are as numerous as the sands by the sea, be called
up for combat; and go with them yourself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We can then attack him wherever we find him,
settling down upon him as dew alights on the ground. None shall survive - neither
he nor any of his followers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And if he retires into a city, all Israel shall
bring ropes to that city and we can drag it into the gorge, so that not even a
pebble of it can be found.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Absalom and all the Israelites pronounced
the counsel of Hushai the Archite better than that of Ahithophel. For the LORD
had decided to undo Ahithophel's good counsel, in order thus to bring Absalom
to ruin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Hushai said to the priests Zadok and
Abiathar: &quot;This is the counsel Ahithophel gave Absalom and the elders of
Israel, and this is what I counseled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So send a warning to David immediately, not to
spend the night at the fords near the desert, but to cross over without fail.
Otherwise the king and all the people with him will be destroyed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at
En-rogel, since they could not risk being seen entering the city. A maidservant
was to come with information for them, and they in turn were to go and report
to King David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But an attendant saw them and informed Absalom.
They sped on their way and reached the house of a man in Bahurim who had a
cistern in his courtyard. They let themselves down into this, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the housewife took the cover and spread it
over the cistern, strewing ground grain on the cover so that nothing could be
noticed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Absalom's servants came to the woman at
the house, they asked, &quot;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&quot; The woman
replied, &quot;They went by a short while ago toward the water.&quot; They
searched, but found no one, and so returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as they left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan came
up out of the cistern and went on to inform King David. They said to him:
&quot;Leave! Cross the water at once, for Ahithophel has given the following
counsel in regard to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David and all his people moved on and
crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had not crossed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not
acted upon, he saddled his ass and departed, going to his home in his own city.
Then, having left orders concerning his family, he hanged himself. And so he
died and was buried in his father's tomb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now David had gone to Mahanaim when Absalom
crossed the Jordan accompanied by all the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom had put Amasa in command of the army in
Joab's place. Amasa was the son of an Ishmaelite named Ithra, who had married
Abigail, daughter of Jesse and sister of Joab's mother Zeruiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel and Absalom encamped in the territory of
Gilead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi, son of
Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir, son of Ammiel from Lodebar, and
Barzillai, the Gileadite from Rogelim, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>brought couches, coverlets, basins and earthenware,
as well as wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>honey, butter and cheese from the flocks and
herds, for David and those who were with him to eat; for they said, &quot;The
people have been hungry and tired and thirsty in the desert.&quot; </p>
