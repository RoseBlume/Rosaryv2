<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, when King Ahasuerus' wrath had
cooled, he thought over what Vashti had done and what had been decreed against
her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king's personal attendants suggested:
&quot;Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let the king appoint commissaries in all the
provinces of his realm to bring together all beautiful young virgins to the
harem in the stronghold of Susa. Under the care of the royal eunuch Hegai,
custodian of the women, let cosmetics be given them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the girl who pleases the king shall reign
in place of Vashti.&quot; This suggestion pleased the king, and he acted
accordingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was in the stronghold of Susa a certain
Jew named Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who had been exiled from Jerusalem with the
captives taken with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, had deported. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10T href="__PD9.HTM#$10T">1</a></sup></font></sup> He was foster father to Hadassah, that is,
Esther, his cousin; for she had lost both father and mother. The girl was
beautifully formed and lovely to behold. On the death of her father and mother,
Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king's order and decree had been
obeyed and many maidens brought together to the stronghold of Susa under the
care of Hegai, Esther also was brought in to the royal palace under the care of
Hegai, custodian of the women. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The girl pleased him and won his favor. So he
promptly furnished her with cosmetics and provisions. Then picking out seven
maids for her from the royal palace, he transferred both her and her maids to
the best place in the harem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Esther did not reveal her nationality or
family, for Mordecai had commanded her not to do so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Day by day Mordecai would walk about in front
of the court of the harem, to learn how Esther was faring and what was to
become of her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each girl went in turn to visit King Ahasuerus
after the twelve months' preparation decreed for the women. Of this period of
beautifying treatment, six months were spent with oil of myrrh, and the other
six months with perfumes and cosmetics. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, when the girl was to visit the king, she
was allowed to take with her from the harem to the royal palace whatever she
chose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She would go in the evening and return in the
morning to a second harem under the care of the royal eunuch Shaashgaz,
custodian of the concubines. She could not return to the king unless he was
pleased with her and had her summoned by name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for Esther, daughter of Abihail and adopted
daughter of his nephew Mordecai, when her turn came to visit the king, she did
not ask for anything but what the royal eunuch Hegai, custodian of the women,
suggested. Yet she won the admiration of all who saw her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Esther was led to King Ahasuerus in his palace
in the tenth month, Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king loved Esther more than all other
women, and of all the virgins she won his favor and benevolence. So he placed
the royal diadem on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10U href="__PD9.HTM#$10U">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then the king gave a great feast in honor of
Esther to all his officials and ministers, granting a holiday to the provinces
and bestowing gifts with royal bounty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10V href="__PD9.HTM#$10V">3</a></sup></font></sup> [To resume: From the time the virgins had been
brought together, and while Mordecai was passing his time at the king's gate, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Esther had not revealed her family or nationality,
because Mordecai had told her not to; and Esther continued to follow Mordecai's
instructions, just as she had when she was being brought up by him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10W href="__PD9.HTM#$10W">4</a></sup></font></sup> And during the time that Mordecai spent at the
king's gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the royal eunuchs who guarded the
entrance, had plotted in anger to lay hands on King Ahasuerus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the plot became known to Mordecai, he told
Queen Esther, who in turn informed the king for Mordecai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-10X href="__PD9.HTM#$10X">5</a></sup></font></sup> The matter was investigated and verified, and
both of them were hanged on a gibbet. This was written in the annals for the
king's use.] </p>
