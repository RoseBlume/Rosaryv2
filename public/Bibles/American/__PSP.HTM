<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace,
content and prosperous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I had a terrifying dream as I lay in bed, and
the images and the visions of my mind frightened me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So I issued a decree that all the wise men of
Babylon should be brought before me to give the interpretation of the dream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and
astrologers had come in, I related the dream before them; but none of them
could tell me its meaning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M6 href="__PSP.HTM#$2M6">1</a></sup></font></sup> Finally there came before me Daniel, whose
name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the
holy God. I repeated the dream to him: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I
know that the spirit of the holy God is in you and no mystery is too difficult
for you; tell me the meaning of the visions that I saw in my dream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;These were the visions I saw while in
bed: I saw a tree of great height at the center of the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was large and strong, with its top touching
the heavens, and it could be seen to the ends of the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit
abundant, providing food for all. Under it the wild beasts found shade, in its
branches the birds of the air nested; all men ate of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M7 href="__PSP.HTM#$2M7">2</a></sup></font></sup> In the vision I saw while in bed, a holy
sentinel came down from heaven, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M8 href="__PSP.HTM#$2M8">3</a></sup></font></sup> and cried out: &quot; 'Cut down the tree and
lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit; let the
beasts flee its shade, and the birds its branches. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But leave in the earth its stump and roots,
fettered with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. Let him be bathed
with the dew of heaven; his lot be to eat, among beasts, the grass of the
earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let his mind be changed from the human; let him
be given the sense of a beast, till seven years pass over him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By decree of the sentinels is this decided, by
order of the holy ones, this sentence; That all who live may know that the Most
High rules over the kingdom of men: He can give it to whom he will, or set over
it the lowliest of men.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This is the dream that I, King
Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me its meaning. Although none of
the wise men in my kingdom can tell me the meaning, you can, because the spirit
of the holy God is in you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was
appalled for a while, terrified by his thoughts. &quot;Belteshazzar,&quot; the
king said to him, &quot;let not the dream or its meaning terrify you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2M9 href="__PSP.HTM#$2M9">4</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;My lord,&quot; Belteshazzar replied,
&quot;this dream should be for your enemies, and its meaning for your foes. The
large, strong tree that you saw, with its top touching the heavens, that could
be seen by the whole earth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>which had beautiful foliage and abundant fruit,
providing food for all, under which the wild beasts lived, and in whose
branches the birds of the air dwelt -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you are that tree, O king, large and strong!
Your majesty has become so great as to touch the heavens, and your rule extends
over the whole earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for the king's vision of a holy sentinel
that came down from heaven and proclaimed: 'Cut down the tree and destroy it,
but leave in the earth its stump and roots, fettered with iron and bronze in
the grass of the field; let him be bathed with the dew of heaven, and let his
lot be among wild beasts till seven years pass over him' - Daniel 4:21 this is
its meaning, O king; this is the sentence which the Most High has passed upon
my lord king: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MA href="__PSP.HTM#$2MA">5</a></sup></font></sup> You shall be cast out from among men and dwell
with wild beasts; you shall be given grass to eat like an ox and be bathed with
the dew of heaven; seven years shall pass over you, until you know that the
Most High rules over the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The command that the stump and roots of the
tree are to be left means that your kingdom shall be preserved for you, once
you have learned it is heaven that rules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MB href="__PSP.HTM#$2MB">6</a></sup></font></sup> Therefore, O king, take my advice; atone for
your sins by good deeds, and for your misdeeds by kindness to the poor; then
your prosperity will be long.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Twelve months later, as he was walking on the
roof of the royal palace in Babylon, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MC href="__PSP.HTM#$2MC">7</a></sup></font></sup> the king said, &quot;Babylon the great! Was it
not I, with my great strength, who built it as a royal residence for my
splendor and majesty?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While these words were still on the king's
lips, a voice spoke from heaven, &quot;It has been decreed for you, King
Nebuchadnezzar, that your kingdom is taken from you! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall be cast out from among men, and shall
dwell with wild beasts; you shall be given grass to eat like an ox, and seven
years shall pass over you, until you learn that the Most High rules over the
kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MD href="__PSP.HTM#$2MD">8</a></sup></font></sup> At once this was fulfilled. Nebuchadnezzar was
cast out from among men, he ate grass like an ox, and his body was bathed with
the dew of heaven, until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle, and his
nails like the claws of a bird. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this period was over, I, Nebuchadnezzar,
raised my eyes to heaven; my reason was restored to me, and I blessed the Most
High, I praised and glorified him who lives forever: His dominion is an
everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures through all generations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All who live on the earth are counted as
nothing; he does as he pleases with the powers of heaven as well as with those
who live on the earth. There is no one who can stay his hand or say to him,
&quot;What have you done?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the same time my reason returned to me, and
for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and my splendor returned to me. My
nobles and lords sought me out; I was restored to my kingdom, and became much
greater than before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, I, Nebuchadnezzar, now praise and
exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because all his works are right and his
ways just; and those who walk in pride he is able to humble. </p>

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSM.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.1.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 1:7), is Balatsu-ussur, &quot;protect his
life.&quot; In the king's intention, this would be an abbreviation for Bel-balatsu-ussur.
It would thus include an appeal to the god Bel, originally the name of the city
god of Nippur, and later identified with Marduk, the chief god of Babylon.
Daniel's use of the name would refer the prayer rather to the true God. </p>

any such thing happening to Nebuchadnezzar as is described here. Some scholars
think that the Nebuchadnezzar of this chapter is actually Nabonidus, the father
of Belshazzar, who was mysteriously absent from Babylon for a number of years.
The Biblical author's chief interest was not in the historicity of this popular
tale, but in the object lesson it contained for the proud &quot;divine&quot;
kings of the Seleucid dynasty.</p>
