<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a stalwart man from Benjamin named
Kish, who was the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a
Benjaminite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had a son named Saul, who was a handsome
young man. There was no other Israelite handsomer than Saul; he stood head and
shoulders above the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the asses of Saul's father, Kish, had
wandered off. Kish said to his son Saul, &quot;Take one of the servants with
you and go out and hunt for the asses.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly they went through the hill country
of Ephraim, and through the land of Shalishah. Not finding them there, they
continued through the land of Shaalim without success. They also went through
the land of Benjamin, but they failed to find the animals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said
to the servant who was with him, &quot;Come, let us turn back, lest my father
forget about the asses and become anxious about us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The servant replied, &quot;Listen! There is a
man of God in this city, a man held in high esteem; all that he says is sure to
come true. Let us go there now! Perhaps he can tell us how to accomplish our
errand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Saul said to his servant, &quot;If we go,
what can we offer the man? There is no bread in our bags, and we have no
present to give the man of God. What have we?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P7 href="__P73.HTM#$P7">1</a></sup></font></sup> Again the servant answered Saul, &quot;I have
a quarter of a silver shekel. If I give that to the man of God, he will tell us
our way.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P8 href="__P73.HTM#$P8">2</a></sup></font></sup> (In former times in Israel, anyone who went to
consult God used to say, &quot;Come, let us go to the seer.&quot; For he who is
now called prophet was formerly called seer.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then said to his servant, &quot;Well said!
Come on, let us go!&quot; And they went to the city where the man of God lived.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they were going up the ascent to the city,
they met some girls coming out to draw water and inquired of them, &quot;Is the
seer in town?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P9 href="__P73.HTM#$P9">3</a></sup></font></sup> The girls answered, &quot;Yes, there -
straight ahead. Hurry now; just today he came to the city, because the people
have a sacrifice today on the high place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you enter the city, you may reach him
before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not eat until he
arrives; only after he blesses the sacrifice will the invited guests eat. Go up
immediately, for you should find him right now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they went up to the city. As they entered
it, Samuel was coming toward them on his way to the high place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The day before Saul's arrival, the LORD had
given Samuel the revelation: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;At this time tomorrow I will send you a
man from the land of Benjamin whom you are to anoint as commander of my people
Israel. He shall save my people from the clutches of the Philistines, for I
have witnessed their misery and accepted their cry for help.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD
assured him, &quot;This is the man of whom I told you; he is to govern my
people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul met Samuel in the gateway and said,
&quot;Please tell me where the seer lives.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel answered Saul: &quot;I am the seer. Go
up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me today. In the morning, before
dismissing you, I will tell you whatever you wish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for the asses you lost three days ago, do
not worry about them, for they have been found. Whom does Israel desire
ardently if not you and your father's family?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul replied: &quot;Am I not a Benjaminite, of
one of the smallest tribes of Israel, and is not my clan the least among the
clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why say such things to me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel then took Saul and his servant and
brought them to the room, where he placed them at the head of the guests, of
whom there were about thirty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to the cook, &quot;Bring the portion I
gave you and told you to put aside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PA href="__P73.HTM#$PA">4</a></sup></font></sup> So the cook took up the leg and what went with
it, and placed it before Saul. Samuel said: &quot;This is a reserved portion
that has been set before you. Eat, for it was kept for you until your arrival;
I explained that I was inviting some guests.&quot; Thus Saul dined with Samuel
that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they came down from the high place into
the city, a mattress was spread for Saul on the roof, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he slept there. At daybreak Samuel called
to Saul on the roof, &quot;Get up, and I will start you on your journey.&quot;
Saul rose, and he and Samuel went outside the city together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they were approaching the edge of the town,
Samuel said to Saul, &quot;Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but stay here
yourself for the moment, that I may give you a message from God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

slight change would give &quot;and the fatty tail&quot; as perhaps the original
reading. Sheep in the Near East are exceptionally fat-tailed, and such a
portion would be thought a special delicacy by the Hebrews. However, the ritual
legislation as we know it (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P2P.HTM#PENT.LEV.3.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Lev 3:9) would require
that the fat tail be burned on the altar. If this general rule was later than
the time of Samuel, the present text may have been retouched so as not to seem
to contravene it. A Qumran text has &quot;the festive (leg)&quot; here.<b
