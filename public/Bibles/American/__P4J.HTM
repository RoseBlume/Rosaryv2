<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now, Israel, hear the statutes and
decrees which I am teaching you to observe, that you may live, and may enter in
and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is
giving you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In your observance of the commandments of the
LORD, your God, which I enjoin upon you, you shall not add to what I command
you nor subtract from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have seen with your own eyes what the LORD
did at Baal-peor: the LORD, your God, destroyed from your midst everyone that
followed the Baal of Peor; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but you, who clung to the LORD, your God, are
all alive today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, I teach you the statutes and decrees
as the LORD, my God, has commanded me, that you may observe them in the land
you are entering to occupy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Observe them carefully, for thus will you give
evidence of your wisdom and intelligence to the nations, who will hear of all
these statutes and say, 'This great nation is truly a wise and intelligent
people.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For what great nation is there that has gods so
close to it as the LORD, our God, is to us whenever we call upon him? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Or what great nation has statutes and decrees
that are as just as this whole law which I am setting before you today? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;However, take care and be earnestly on
your guard not to forget the things which your own eyes have seen, nor let them
slip from your memory as long as you live, but teach them to your children and
to your children's children. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-HK href="__P4J.HTM#$HK">1</a></sup></font></sup> There was the day on which you stood before
the LORD, your God, at Horeb, and he said to me, 'Assemble the people for me; I
will have them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me as long as they
live in the land and may so teach their children.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You came near and stood at the foot of the
mountain, which blazed to the very sky with fire and was enveloped in a dense
black cloud. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of
the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; there was only a
voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He proclaimed to you his covenant, which he
commanded you to keep: the ten commandments, which he wrote on two tablets of
stone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD charged me at that time to teach you
the statutes and decrees which you are to observe over in the land you will
occupy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You saw no form at all on the day the
LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire. Be strictly on your
guard, therefore, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>not to degrade yourselves by fashioning an idol
to represent any figure, whether it be the form of a man or a woman, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>of any animal on the earth or of any bird that
flies in the sky, </p>

fish in the waters under the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when you look up to the heavens and behold
the sun or the moon or any star among the heavenly hosts, do not be led astray
into adoring them and serving them. These the LORD, your God, has let fall to
the lot of all other nations under the heavens; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since the LORD was angered against me on your
account and swore that I should not cross the Jordan nor enter the good land
which he is giving you as a heritage, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I myself shall die in this country without
crossing the Jordan; but you will cross over and take possession of that good
land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take heed, therefore, lest, forgetting the
covenant which the LORD, your God, has made with you, you fashion for
yourselves against his command an idol in any form whatsoever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the LORD, your God, is a consuming fire, a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-HM href="__P4J.HTM#$HM">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;When you have children and
grandchildren, and have grown old in the land, should you then degrade
yourselves by fashioning an idol in any form and by this evil done in his sight
provoke the LORD, your God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I call heaven and earth this day to witness
against you, that you shall all quickly perish from the land which you will
occupy when you cross the Jordan. You shall not live in it for any length of
time but shall be promptly wiped out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD will scatter you among the nations,
and there shall remain but a handful of you among the nations to which the LORD
will lead you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There you shall serve gods fashioned by the
hands of man out of wood and stone, gods which can neither see nor hear,
neither eat nor smell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet there too you shall seek the LORD, your
God; and you shall indeed find him when you search after him with your whole
heart and your whole soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In your distress, when all these things shall
have come upon you, you shall finally return to the LORD, your God, and heed
his voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since the LORD, your God, is a merciful God, he
will not abandon and destroy you, nor forget the covenant which under oath he
made with your fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Ask now of the days of old, before your
time, ever since God created man upon the earth; ask from one end of the sky to
the other: Did anything so great ever happen before? Was it ever heard of? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Did a people ever hear the voice of God

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-HN href="__P4J.HTM#$HN">4</a></sup></font></sup> Or did any god venture to go and take a nation
for himself from the midst of another nation, by testings, by signs and
wonders, by war, with his strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great
terrors, all of which the LORD, your God, did for you in Egypt before your very
eyes? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All this you were allowed to see that you might
know the LORD is God and there is no other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Out of the heavens he let you hear his voice to
discipline you; on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard him
speaking out of the fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For love of your fathers he chose their
descendants and personally led you out of Egypt by his great power, </p>

as it is today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is why you must now know, and fix in your

you forever.&quot; </p>
