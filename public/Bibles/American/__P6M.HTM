<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time, when there was no king in Israel,
there was a Levite residing in remote parts of the mountain region of Ephraim
who had taken for himself a concubine from Bethlehem of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His concubine was unfaithful to him and left
him for her father's house in Bethlehem of Judah, where she stayed for some
four months. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Her husband then set out with his servant and a
pair of asses, and went after her to forgive her and take her back. She brought
him into her father's house, and on seeing him, the girl's father joyfully made
him welcome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was detained by the girl's father, and so he
spent three days with this father-in-law of his, eating and drinking and
passing the night there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NO href="__P6M.HTM#$NO">1</a></sup></font></sup> On the fourth day they rose early in the
morning and he prepared to go. But the girl's father said to his son-in-law,
&quot;Fortify yourself with a little food; you can go later on.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they stayed and the two men ate and drank
together. Then the girl's father said to the husband, &quot;Why not decide to
spend the night here and enjoy yourself?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man still made a move to go, but when his
father-in-law pressed him he went back and spent the night there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the fifth morning he rose early to depart,
but the girl's father said, &quot;Fortify yourself and tarry until the
afternoon.&quot; When he and his father-in-law had eaten, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the husband was ready to go with his
concubine and servant, the girl's father said to him, &quot;It is already
growing dusk. Stay for the night. See, the day is coming to an end. Spend the
night here and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow you can start your journey
home.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man, however, refused to stay another
night; he and his concubine set out with a pair of saddled asses, and traveled
till they came opposite Jebus, which is Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since they were near Jebus with the day far
gone, the servant said to his master, &quot;Come, let us turn off to this city
of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his master said to him, &quot;We will not
turn off to a city of foreigners, who are not Israelites, but will go on to
Gibeah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come,&quot; he said to his servant, &quot;let
us make for some other place, either Gibeah or Ramah, to spend the night.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they continued on their way till the sun set
on them when they were abreast of Gibeah of Benjamin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NP href="__P6M.HTM#$NP">2</a></sup></font></sup> There they turned off to enter Gibeah for the
night. The man waited in the public square of the city he had entered, but no
one offered them the shelter of his home for the night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the evening, however, an old man came from
his work in the field; he was from the mountain region of Ephraim, though he
lived among the Benjaminite townspeople of Gibeah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he noticed the traveler in the public
square of the city, the old man asked where he was going, and whence he had
come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to him, &quot;We are traveling from
Bethlehem of Judah far up into the mountain region of Ephraim, where I belong.
I have been to Bethlehem of Judah and am now going back home; but no one has
offered us the shelter of his house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We have straw and fodder for our asses, and
bread and wine for the woman and myself and for our servant; there is nothing
else we need.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You are welcome,&quot; the old man said
to him, &quot;but let me provide for all your needs, and do not spend the night
in the public square.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he led them to his house and provided fodder
for the asses. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NQ href="__P6M.HTM#$NQ">3</a></sup></font></sup> While they were enjoying themselves, the men
of the city, who were corrupt, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They
said to the old man whose house it was, &quot;Bring out your guest, that we may
abuse him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The owner of the house went out to them and
said, &quot;No, my brothers; do not be so wicked. Since this man is my guest,
do not commit this crime. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rather let me bring out my maiden daughter or
his concubine. Ravish them, or do whatever you want with them; but against the
man you must not commit this wanton crime.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the men would not listen to his host, the
husband seized his concubine and thrust her outside to them. They had relations
with her and abused her all night until the following dawn, when they let her
go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then at daybreak the woman came and collapsed
at the entrance of the house in which her husband was a guest, where she lay
until the morning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When her husband rose that day and opened the
door of the house to start out again on his journey, there lay the woman, his
concubine, at the entrance of the house with her hands on the threshold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to her, &quot;Come, let us go&quot;;
but there was no answer. So the man placed her on an ass and started out again
for home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NR href="__P6M.HTM#$NR">4</a></sup></font></sup> On reaching home, he took a knife to the body
of his concubine, cut her into twelve pieces, and sent them throughout the
territory of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Everyone who saw this said, &quot;Nothing like
this has been done or seen from the day the Israelites came up from the land of
Egypt to this day. Take note of it, and state what you propose to do.&quot; </p>
