against the land of the Chaldeans, through the prophet Jeremiah: </p>

publish it, hide it not, but say: Babylon is taken, Bel confounded, Merodach
shattered; her images are put to shame, her idols shattered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A people from the north advances against her to
turn her land into a desert, So that no one shall live there, because man and
beast have fled away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In those days, at that time, says the LORD, the
men of Israel and of Judah shall come, Weeping as they come, to seek the LORD,
their God; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to their goal in Zion they shall ask the way.
&quot;Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD with covenant everlasting, never
to be forgotten.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Lost sheep were my people, their shepherds
misled them, straggling on the mountains; From mountain to hill they wandered,
losing the way to their fold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whoever came upon them devoured them, and their
enemies said, &quot;We incur no guilt, Because they sinned against the LORD,
the hope of their fathers, their abode of justice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Flee from Babylon, leave the land of the
Chaldeans, be like the rams at the head of the flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See, I am stirring up against Babylon a band of
great nations from the north; from there they advance, and she shall be taken.
Their arrows are arrows of the skilled warrior; none shall return without
effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Chaldea shall be their plunder, and all her
plunderers shall be enriched, says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yes, rejoice and exult, you that plunder my
portion; Frisk like calves on the green, snort like stallions! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your mother shall be sorely put to shame, she
that bore you shall be abashed; See, the last of the nations, a desert, dry and
waste. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because of the LORD'S wrath she shall be empty,
and become a total desert; Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled and
catch his breath, at all her wounds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take your posts encircling Babylon, you who
bend the bow; Shoot at her, spare not your arrows, </p>

She surrenders, her bastions fall, her walls are torn down: Vengeance of the
LORD is this! Take revenge on her, as she has done, do to her; for she sinned
against the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Cut off from Babylon the sower and him who
wields the sickle in harvest time! Before the destroying sword, each of them
turns to his own people, everyone flees to his own land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A stray sheep was Israel that lions pursued;
Formerly the king of Assyria devoured her, now Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gnaws
her bones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God
of Israel: I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as once I punished
the king of Assyria; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I will bring back Israel to her fold, to
feed on Carmel and Bashan, And on Mount Ephraim and Gilead, till she has her
fill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In those days, at that time, says the LORD:
They shall seek Israel's guilt, but it shall be no more, and Judah's sins, but
these shall no longer be found; for I will forgive the remnant I preserve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21

live in Pekod; Slaughter and doom them, says the LORD, do all I have commanded
you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Battle alarm in the land, dire destruction! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How has the hammer of the whole earth been
broken and shattered! What an object of horror Babylon has become among the
nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You ensnared yourself, and were caught, O
Babylon, before you knew it! You were discovered and seized, because you
challenged the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD opens his armory and brings forth the
weapons of his wrath; For the Lord GOD of hosts has work to do in the land of
the Chaldeans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come upon her from every side, open her
granaries, Pile up her goods in heaps and doom it, leave not a remnant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Slay all her oxen, let them go down to the
slaughter; Woe to them! their day has come, the time of their punishment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Listen! the fugitives, the escaped from the
land of Babylon: They announce in Zion the vengeance of the LORD, our God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Call up against Babylon archers, all who bend
the bow; Encamp around her, let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; as she
has done, do to her, For she insulted the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore her young men shall fall in her
streets, all her warriors shall perish on that day, says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am against you, man of insolence, says the
Lord GOD of hosts; For your day has come, the time for me to punish you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Insolence stumbles and falls; there is no one to

around him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the LORD of hosts: Oppressed are the
men of Israel, and with them the men of Judah; All their captors hold them fast
and refuse to let them go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Strong is their avenger, whose name is LORD of
hosts; He will defend their cause with success, and give rest to the earth, but
unrest to those who live in Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A sword upon the Chaldeans, says the LORD, upon
Babylon's people, her princes and wise men! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A sword upon the soothsayers, that they may
become fools! A sword upon her warriors, that they may tremble; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A sword upon her motley throng, that they may become
women! A sword upon her treasures, that they may be plundered; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A sword upon her waters, that they may dry up!
For it is a land of idols, and they shall be made frantic by fearful things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As when God overturned Sodom and Gomorrah, with
their neighbors, says the LORD, Not a man shall dwell there, no human being

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See! a people comes from the north, a great

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bow and javelin they wield, cruel and pitiless
are they; They sound like the roaring sea, as they ride forth on steeds, Each
in his place for battle against you, daughter Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Babylon hears news of them, and
helpless fall his hands; Anguish seizes him, throes like a mother's in
childbirth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As when a lion comes up from the Jordan's
thicket to the permanent feeding grounds, So I, in one instant, will drive them

to account? what shepherd can stand against me? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD which he

Chaldeans: They shall be dragged away, even the smallest sheep; their own
pasture shall be aghast because of them. </p>
