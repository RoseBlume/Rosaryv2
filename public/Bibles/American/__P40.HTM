</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-FF href="__P40.HTM#$FF">1</a></sup></font></sup> Then the Israelites moved on and encamped in
the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jericho stretch of the Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Balak, son of Zippor, saw all that Israel
did to the Amorites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Indeed, Moab feared the Israelites greatly
because of their numbers, and detested them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Moab said to the elders of Midian,
&quot;Soon this horde will devour all the country around us as an ox devours
the grass of the field.&quot; And Balak, Zippor's son, who was king of Moab at
that time, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>sent messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, at
Pethor on the Euphrates, in the land of the Amawites, summoning him with these
words, &quot;A people has come here from Egypt who now cover the face of the
earth and are settling down opposite us! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-FG href="__P40.HTM#$FG">2</a></sup></font></sup> Please come and curse this people for us; they
are stronger than we are. We may then be able to defeat them and drive them out
of the country. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed and whoever you
curse is cursed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the elders of Moab and of Midian left with
the divination fee in hand and went to Balaam. When they had given him Balak's
message, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to them in reply, &quot;Stay here
overnight, and I will give you whatever answer the LORD gives me.&quot; So the
princes of Moab lodged with Balaam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then God came to Balaam and said, &quot;Who are
these men visiting you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Balaam answered God, &quot;Balak, son of
Zippor, king of Moab, sent me the message: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'This people that came here from Egypt now cover
the face of the earth. Please come and lay a curse on them for us; we may then
be able to give them battle and drive them out.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But God said to Balaam, &quot;Do not go with
them and do not curse this people, for they are blessed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next morning Balaam arose and told the
princes of Balak, &quot;Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused
to let me go with you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the princes of Moab went back to Balak with
the report, &quot;Balaam refused to come with us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Balak again sent princes, who were more
numerous and more distinguished than the others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On coming to Balaam they told him, &quot;This
is what Balak, son of Zippor, has to say: Please do not refuse to come to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will reward you very handsomely and will do
anything you ask of me. Please come and lay a curse on this people for
me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Balaam replied to Balak's officials,
&quot;Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do
anything, small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD, my God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But, you too shall stay here overnight, till I
learn what else the LORD may tell me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That night God came to Balaam and said to him,
&quot;If these men have come to summon you, you may go with them; yet only on
the condition that you do exactly as I tell you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the next morning when Balaam arose, he
saddled his ass, and went off with the princes of Moab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-FH href="__P40.HTM#$FH">3</a></sup></font></sup> But now the anger of God flared up at him for
going, and the angel of the LORD stationed himself on the road to hinder him as
he was riding along on his ass, accompanied by two of his servants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing
on the road with sword drawn, she turned off the road and went into the field,
and Balaam had to beat her to bring her back on the road. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the angel of the LORD took his stand in a
narrow lane between vineyards with a stone wall on each side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the ass saw the angel of the LORD there,
she shrank against the wall; and since she squeezed Balaam's leg against it, he
beat her again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The angel of the LORD then went ahead, and
stopped next in a passage so narrow that there was no room to move either to
the right or to the left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the ass saw the angel of the LORD there,
she cowered under Balaam. So, in anger, he again beat the ass with his stick. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now the LORD opened the mouth of the ass,
and she asked Balaam, &quot;What have I done to you that you should beat me
these three times?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have acted so willfully against me,&quot;
said Balaam to the ass, &quot;that if I but had a sword at hand, I would kill
you here and now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the ass said to Balaam, &quot;Am I not your
own beast, and have you not always ridden upon me until now? Have I been in the
habit of treating you this way before?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; replied Balaam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD removed the veil from Balaam's
eyes, so that he too saw the angel of the LORD standing on the road with sword
drawn; and he fell on his knees and bowed to the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the angel of the LORD said to him,
&quot;Why have you beaten your ass these three times? It is I who have come
armed to hinder you because this rash journey of yours is directly opposed to
me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the ass saw me, she turned away from me
these three times. If she had not turned away from me, I would have killed you;
her I would have spared.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Balaam said to the angel of the LORD,
&quot;I have sinned. Yet I did not know that you stood against me to oppose my
journey. Since it has displeased you, I will go back home.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam,
&quot;Go with the men; but you may say only what I tell you.&quot; So Balaam
went on with the princes of Balak. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he
went out to meet him at the boundary city Ir-Moab on the Arnon at the end of
the Moabite territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he said to Balaam, &quot;I sent an urgent
summons to you! Why did you not come to me? Did you think I could not reward
you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Balaam answered him, &quot;Well, I have come to
you after all. But what power have I to say anything? I can speak only what God
puts in my mouth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to
Kiriath-huzoth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Here Balak slaughtered oxen and sheep, and sent
portions to Balaam and to the princes who were with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next morning Balak took Balaam up on Bamoth-baal,
and from there he saw some of the clans. </p>
