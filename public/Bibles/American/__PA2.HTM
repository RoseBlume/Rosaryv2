</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The following men came to David in Ziklag while
he was still under banishment from Saul, son of Kish; they, too, were among the
warriors who helped him in his battles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were archers who could use either the
right or the left hand, both in slinging stones and in shooting arrows with the
bow. They were some of Saul's kinsmen, from Benjamin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahiezer was their chief, along with Joash, both
sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; also Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth; Beracah;
Jehu, from Anathoth; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a warrior on the level
of the Thirty, and in addition to their number; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad from
Gederah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah;
Shephatiah the Haruphite; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Ishbaal,
who were Korahites; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joelah, finally, and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham,
from Gedor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some of the Gadites also went over to David
when he was at the stronghold in the wilderness. They were valiant warriors,
experienced soldiers equipped with shield and spear, who bore themselves like
lions, and were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ezer was their chief, Obadiah was second, Eliab
third, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These Gadites were army commanders, the lesser
placed over hundreds and the greater over thousands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was they who crossed over the Jordan when it
was overflowing both its banks in the first month, and dispersed all who were
in the valleys to the east and to the west. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some Benjaminites and Judahites also came to
David at the stronghold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David went out to meet them and addressed them
in these words: &quot;If you come peacefully, to help me, I am of a mind to
have you join me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies though my
hands have done no wrong, may the God of our fathers see and punish you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then spirit enveloped Amasai, the chief of the
Thirty, who spoke: &quot;We are yours, O David, we are with you, O son of
Jesse. Peace, peace to you, and peace to him who helps you; your God it is who
helps you.&quot; So David received them and placed them among the leaders of
his troops. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Men from Manasseh also deserted to David when
he came with the Philistines to battle against Saul. However, he did not help
the Philistines, for their lords took counsel and sent him home, saying,
&quot;At the cost of our heads he will desert to his master Saul.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he was returning to Ziklag, therefore, these
deserted to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad,
Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands of Manasseh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They helped David by taking charge of his
troops, for they were all warriors and became commanders of his army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And from day to day men kept coming to David's
help until there was a vast encampment, like an encampment of angels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is the muster of the detachments of armed
troops that came to David at Hebron to transfer to him Saul's kingdom, as the
LORD had ordained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-VC href="__PA2.HTM#$VC">1</a></sup></font></sup> Judahites bearing shields and spears: six
thousand eight hundred armed troops. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the Simeonites, warriors fit for battle:
seven thousand one hundred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the Levites: four thousand six hundred, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>along with Jehoiada, leader of the line of
Aaron, with another three thousand seven hundred, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Zadok, a young warrior, with twenty-two
princes of his father's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the Benjaminites, the brethren of Saul: three
thousand - until this time, most of them had held their allegiance to the house
of Saul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the Ephraimites: twenty thousand eight
hundred warriors, men renowned in their ancestral houses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen
thousand, designated by name to come and make David king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the Issacharites, their chiefs who were
endowed with an understanding of the times and who knew what Israel had to do:
two hundred chiefs, together with all their brethren under their command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Zebulun, men fit for military service, set
in battle array with every kind of weapon for war: fifty thousand men rallying
with a single purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Naphtali: one thousand captains, and with
them, armed with shield and lance, thirty-seven thousand men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

twenty-eight thousand six hundred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Asher, fit for military service and set in
battle array: forty thousand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the other side of the Jordan, of the
Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, men equipped with every
kind of weapon of war: one hundred and twenty thousand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All these soldiers, drawn up in battle order,
came to Hebron with the resolute intention of making David king over all
Israel. The rest of Israel was likewise of one mind to make David king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They remained with David for three days,
feasting and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, their neighbors from as far as
Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on asses, camels, mules, and
oxen - provisions in great quantity of meal, pressed figs, raisins, wine, oil,
oxen, and sheep. For there was rejoicing in Israel. </p>
