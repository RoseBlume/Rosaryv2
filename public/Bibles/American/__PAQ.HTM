<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 6</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Solomon said: &quot;The LORD intends to
dwell in the dark cloud. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have truly built you a princely house and
dwelling, where you may abide forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Turning about, the king greeted the whole
community of Israel as they stood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said: &quot;Blessed be the LORD, the God of
Israel, who with his own mouth made a promise to my father David and by his own
hands brought it to fulfillment. He said: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Since the day I brought my people out of the
land of Egypt, I have not chosen any city from among all the tribes of Israel
for the building of a temple to my honor, nor have I chosen any man to be
commander of my people Israel; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but now I choose Jerusalem, where I shall be
honored, and I choose David to rule my people Israel.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My father David wished to build a temple to the
honor of the LORD, the God of Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but the LORD said to him: 'In wishing to build
a temple to my honor, you do well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, you shall not build the temple;
rather, your son whom you will beget shall build the temple to my honor.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now the LORD has fulfilled the promise
that he made. I have succeeded my father David and have taken my seat on the
throne of Israel, as the LORD foretold, and I have built the temple to the
honor of the LORD, the God of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And I have placed there the ark, in which
abides the covenant of the LORD which he made with the Israelites.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon then took his place before the altar of
the LORD in the presence of the whole community of Israel and stretched forth
his hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-W8 href="__PAQ.HTM#$W8">1</a></sup></font></sup> He had made a bronze platform five cubits
long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, which he had placed in the
middle of the courtyard. Having ascended it, Solomon knelt in the presence of
the whole of Israel and stretched forth his hands toward heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus he prayed: &quot;LORD, God of Israel,
there is no god like you in heaven or on earth; you keep your covenant and show
kindness to your servants who are wholeheartedly faithful to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have kept the promise you made to my father
David, your servant. With your own mouth you spoke it, and by your own hand you
have brought it to fulfillment this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, therefore, LORD, God of Israel, keep the
further promise you made to my father David, your servant, when you said, 'You
shall always have someone from your line to sit before me on the throne of
Israel, provided only that your descendants look to their conduct so as always
to live according to my law, even as you have lived in my presence.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, LORD, God of Israel, may this promise
which you made to your servant David be confirmed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Can it indeed be that God dwells with
mankind on earth? If the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain you,
how much less this temple which I have built! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Look kindly on the prayer and petition of your
servant, O LORD, my God, and listen to the cry of supplication your servant
makes before you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May your eyes watch day and night over this
temple, the place where you have decreed you shall be honored; may you heed the
prayer which I your servant offer toward this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Listen to the petitions of your servant and of
your people Israel which they direct toward this place. Listen from your
heavenly dwelling, and when you have heard, pardon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When any man sins against his neighbor
and is required to take an oath of execration against himself, and when he comes
for the oath before your altar in this temple, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen from heaven: take action and pass
judgment on your servants, requiting the wicked man and holding him responsible
for his conduct, but absolving the innocent and rewarding him according to his
virtue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When your people Israel have sinned against you
and are defeated by the enemy, but afterward they return and praise your name,
and they pray to you and entreat you in this temple, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen from heaven and forgive the sin of your
people Israel, and bring them back to the land which you gave them and their
fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the sky is closed so that there is no
rain, because they have sinned against you, but then they pray toward this
place and praise your name, and they withdraw from sin because you afflict
them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen in heaven and forgive the sin of your
servants and of your people Israel. But teach them the right way to live, and
send rain upon your land which you gave your people as their heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When there is famine in the land, when there is
pestilence, or blight, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillars; when their
enemies besiege them at any of their gates; whenever there is a plague or
sickness of any kind; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when any Israelite of all your people offers a
prayer or petition of any kind, and in awareness of his affliction and pain,
stretches out his hands toward this temple, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen from your heavenly dwelling place, and
forgive. Knowing his heart, render to everyone according to his conduct, for
you alone know the hearts of men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So may they fear you and walk in your ways as
long as they live on the land you gave our fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;For the foreigner, too, who is not of
your people Israel, when he comes from a distant land to honor your great name,
your mighty power, and your outstretched arm, when they come in prayer to this
temple, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen from your heavenly dwelling place, and
do whatever the foreigner entreats you, that all the peoples of the earth may
know your name, fearing you as do your people Israel, and knowing that this
house which I have built is dedicated to your honor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When your people go forth to war against
their enemies, wherever you send them, and pray to you in the direction of this
city and of the house I have built to your honor, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen from heaven to their prayer and
petition, and defend their cause. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they sin against you (for there is no man
who does not sin), and in your anger against them you deliver them to the
enemy, so that their captors deport them to another land, far or near, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when they repent in the land where they are
captive and are converted, when they entreat you in the land of their captivity
and say, 'We have sinned and done wrong; we have been wicked,' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and with their whole heart and with their whole
soul they turn back to you in the land of those who hold them captive, when
they pray in the direction of their land which you gave their fathers, and of
the city you have chosen, and of the house which I have built to your honor, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>listen from your heavenly dwelling place, hear
their prayer and petitions, and uphold their cause. Forgive your people who
have sinned against you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My God, may your eyes be open and your ears
attentive to the prayer of this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now, &quot;Advance, LORD God, to your
resting place, you and the ark of your majesty. May your priests, LORD God, be
clothed with salvation, may your faithful ones rejoice in good things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>LORD God, reject not the plea of your anointed,
remember the devotion of David, your servant.&quot; </p>
