unbelief and its rejection of Jesus as savior astonished and puzzled
Christians. It constituted a serious problem for them in view of God's specific
preparation of Israel for the advent of the Messiah. Paul addresses himself
here to the essential question of how the divine plan could be frustrated by
Israel's unbelief. At the same time, he discourages both complacency and
anxiety on the part of Gentiles. To those who might boast of their superior
advantage over Jews, he warns that their enjoyment of the blessings assigned to
Israel can be terminated. To those who might anxiously ask, &quot;How can we be
sure that Israel's fate will not be ours?&quot; he replies that only unbelief
can deprive one of salvation.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$47U href="__PYX.HTM#-47U">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [1-5] The apostle speaks in strong
terms of the depth of his grief over the unbelief of his own people. He would
willingly undergo a curse himself for the sake of their coming to the knowledge
of Christ (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:3; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P3D.HTM#PENT.LEV.27.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Lev
27:28-29). His love for them derives from God's continuing choice of
them and from the spiritual benefits that God bestows on them and through them
on all of humanity (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:4-5). </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$47V href="__PYX.HTM#-47V">3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [5] Some editors punctuate this
verse differently and prefer the translation, &quot;Of whom is Christ according
to the flesh, who is God over all.&quot; However, Paul's point is that God who
is over all aimed to use Israel, which had been entrusted with every privilege,
in outreach to the entire world through the Messiah.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$47W href="__PYX.HTM#-47W">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [10] Children by one husband, our
father Isaac: Abraham had two children, Ishmael and Isaac, by two wives, Hagar
and Sarah, respectively. In that instance Isaac, although born later than
Ishmael, became the bearer of the messianic promise. In the case of twins born
to Rebecca, God's elective procedure is seen even more dramatically, and again
the younger, contrary to Semitic custom, is given the preference.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$47X href="__PYX.HTM#-47X">5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [13] The literal rendering,
&quot;Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,&quot; suggests an attitude of divine
hostility that is not implied in Paul's statement. In Semitic usage
&quot;hate&quot; means to love less; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWX.HTM#GOSP.LUK.14.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
14:26 with <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVJ.HTM#GOSP.MAT.10.37"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 10:37. Israel's
unbelief reflects the mystery of the divine election that is always operative
within it. Mere natural descent from Abraham does not ensure the full
possession of the divine gifts; it is God's sovereign prerogative to bestow
this fullness upon, or to withhold it from, whomsoever he wishes; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVC.HTM#GOSP.MAT.3.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
3:9; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXG.HTM#GOSP.JOH.8.39"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 8:39. The choice of Jacob over
Esau is a case in point.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$47Y href="__PYX.HTM#-47Y">6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [14-18] The principle of divine
election does not invite Christians to theoretical inquiry concerning the
nonelected, nor does this principle mean that God is unfair in his dealings
with humanity. The instruction concerning divine election is a part of the
gospel and reveals that the gift of faith is the enactment of God's mercy
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:16). God raised up Moses to display that
mercy, and Pharaoh to display divine severity in punishing those who
obstinately oppose their Creator.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$47Z href="__PYX.HTM#-47Z">7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [18] The basic biblical principle
is: those who will not see or hear shall not see or hear. On the other hand,
the same God who thus makes stubborn or hardens the heart can reconstruct it
through the work of the holy Spirit.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$480 href="__PYX.HTM#-480">8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [19-29] The apostle responds to the
objection that if God rules over faith through the principle of divine
election, God cannot then accuse unbelievers of sin (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans
9:19). For Paul, this objection is in the last analysis a
manifestation of human insolence, and his &quot;answer&quot; is less an
explanation of God's ways than the rejection of an argument that places
humanity on a level with God. At the same time, Paul shows that God is far less
arbitrary than appearances suggest, for God endures with much patience
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.22"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:22) a person like the Pharaoh of the
Exodus.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$481 href="__PYX.HTM#-481">9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [25] Beloved: in Semitic discourse
means &quot;preferred&quot; or &quot;favorite&quot; (cf
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:13). See <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PT2.HTM#PROPHB.HOS.2.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hosea
2:1, which is transposed after <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PT3.HTM#PROPHB.HOS.3.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hosea 3:5
in the NAB.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$482 href="__PYX.HTM#-482">10</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [30-33] In the conversion of the
Gentiles and, by contrast, of relatively few Jews, the Old Testament prophecies
are seen to be fulfilled; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:25-29.
Israel feared that the doctrine of justification through faith would jeopardize
the validity of the Mosaic law, and so they never reached their goal of
righteousness that they had sought to attain through meticulous observance of
the law (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.31"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:31). Since Gentiles, including
especially Greeks and Romans, had a great regard for righteousness, Paul's
statement concerning Gentiles in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYX.HTM#NTLET.ROM.9.30"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 9:30 is to
be understood from a Jewish perspective: quite evidently they had not been
interested in &quot;God's&quot; righteousness, for it had not been revealed to
them; but now in response to the proclamation of the gospel they respond in
faith.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$483 href="__PYX.HTM#-483">11</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [32] Paul discusses Israel as a
whole from the perspective of contemporary Jewish rejection of Jesus as
Messiah. The Old Testament and much of Jewish noncanonical literature in fact
reflect a fervent faith in divine mercy.</p>
