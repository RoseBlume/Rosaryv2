<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the high priest asked, &quot;Is this
so?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he replied, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40W href="__PY1.HTM#$40W">1</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;My
brothers and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham
while he was in Mesopotamia, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40X href="__PY1.HTM#$40X">2</a></sup></font></sup> before he had settled in
Haran, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to him, 'Go forth from your land and
(from) your kinsfolk to the land that I will show you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went forth from the land of the Chaldeans
and settled in Haran. And from there, after his father died, he made him
migrate to this land where you now dwell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even
a foot's length, but he did promise to give it to him and his descendants as a
possession, even though he was childless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And God spoke thus, 'His descendants shall be
aliens in a land not their own, where they shall be enslaved and oppressed for
four hundred years; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but I will bring judgment on the nation they
serve,' God said, 'and after that they will come out and worship me in this
place.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he gave him the covenant of circumcision,
and so he became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, as
Isaac did Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph,
sold him into slavery in Egypt; but God was with him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and rescued him from all his afflictions. He granted
him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who put him in charge
of Egypt and (of) his entire household. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then a famine and great affliction struck all
Egypt and Canaan, and our ancestors could find no food; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but when Jacob heard that there was grain in
Egypt, he sent our ancestors there a first time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The second time, Joseph made himself known to
his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, inviting
him and his whole clan, seventy-five persons; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Jacob went down to Egypt. And he and our
ancestors died </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and were brought back to Shechem and placed in
the tomb that Abraham had purchased for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor
at Shechem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When the time drew near for the
fulfillment of the promise that God pledged to Abraham, the people had
increased and become very numerous in Egypt, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>until another king who knew nothing of Joseph
came to power (in Egypt). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He dealt shrewdly with our people and oppressed
(our) ancestors by forcing them to expose their infants, that they might not
survive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this time Moses was born, and he was
extremely beautiful. For three months he was nursed in his father's house; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter
adopted him and brought him up as her own son. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses was educated (in) all the wisdom of the
Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When he was forty years old, he decided
to visit his kinsfolk, the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he saw one of them treated unjustly, he
defended and avenged the oppressed man by striking down the Egyptian. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He assumed (his) kinsfolk would understand that
God was offering them deliverance through him, but they did not understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day he appeared to them as they were
fighting and tried to reconcile them peacefully, saying, 'Men, you are
brothers. Why are you harming one another?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the one who was harming his neighbor pushed
him aside, saying, 'Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Are you thinking of killing me as you killed
the Egyptian yesterday?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses fled when he heard this and settled as an
alien in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Forty years later, an angel appeared to
him in the desert near Mount Sinai in the flame of a burning bush. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight,
and as he drew near to look at it, the voice of the Lord came, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'I am the God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.' Then Moses, trembling, did not dare to look
at it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Lord said to him, 'Remove the sandals
from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have witnessed the affliction of my people in
Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Come
now, I will send you to Egypt.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This Moses, whom they had rejected with the
words, 'Who appointed you ruler and judge?' God sent as (both) ruler and
deliverer, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This man led them out, performing wonders and
signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the desert for forty years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was this Moses who said to the Israelites,
'God will raise up for you, from among your own kinsfolk, a prophet like me.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was he who, in the assembly in the desert,
was with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our ancestors, and
he received living utterances to hand on to us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him;
instead, they pushed him aside and in their hearts turned back to Egypt, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will be our
leaders. As for that Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know
what has happened to him.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they made a calf in those days, offered
sacrifice to the idol, and reveled in the works of their hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then God turned and handed them over to worship
the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you
bring me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the desert, O house of
Israel? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No, you took up the tent of Moloch and the star
of (your) god Rephan, the images that you made to worship. So I shall take you
into exile beyond Babylon.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Our ancestors had the tent of testimony
in the desert just as the One who spoke to Moses directed him to make it
according to the pattern he had seen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Our ancestors who inherited it brought it with
Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out from before our
ancestors, up to the time of David, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who found favor in the sight of God and asked
that he might find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Solomon built a house for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made
by human hands. As the prophet says: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'The heavens are my throne, the earth is my
footstool. What kind of house can you build for me? says the Lord, or what is
to be my resting place? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Did not my hand make all these things?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in
heart and ears, you always oppose the holy Spirit; you are just like your
ancestors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Which of the prophets did your ancestors not
persecute? They put to death those who foretold the coming of the righteous
one, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You received the law as transmitted by angels,
but you did not observe it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this, they were infuriated, and
they ground their teeth at him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he, filled with the holy Spirit, looked up
intently to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right
hand of God, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40Y href="__PY1.HTM#$40Y">3</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he said, &quot;Behold, I see the heavens
opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they cried out in a loud voice, covered
their ears, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40Z href="__PY1.HTM#$40Z">4</a></sup></font></sup> and rushed upon him together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They threw him out of the city, and began to
stone him. The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man
named Saul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>59
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they were stoning Stephen, he called out,
&quot;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-410 href="__PY1.HTM#$410">5</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a
loud voice, &quot;Lord, do not hold this sin against them&quot;; and when he
said this, he fell asleep.</p>
