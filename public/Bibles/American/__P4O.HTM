<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Hear, O Israel! You are now about to
cross the Jordan to enter in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than
yourselves, having large cities fortified to the sky, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Anakim, a people great and tall. You know
of them and have heard it said of them, 'Who can stand up against the Anakim?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Understand, then, today that it is the LORD,
your God, who will cross over before you as a consuming fire; he it is who will
reduce them to nothing and subdue them before you, so that you can drive them
out and destroy them quickly, as the LORD promised you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the LORD, your God, has thrust them out
of your way, do not say to yourselves, 'It is because of my merits that the
LORD has brought me in to possess this land'; for it is really because of the
wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out before you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No, it is not because of your merits or the
integrity of your heart that you are going in to take possession of their land;
but the LORD, your God, is driving these nations out before you on account of
their wickedness and in order to keep the promise which he made on oath to your
fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Understand this, therefore: it is not because
of your merits that the LORD, your God, is giving you this good land to
possess, for you are a stiff-necked people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Bear in mind and do not forget how you
angered the LORD, your God, in the desert. From the day you left the land of
Egypt until you arrived in this place, you have been rebellious toward the
LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At Horeb you so provoked the LORD that he was
angry enough to destroy you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when I had gone up the mountain to receive the
stone tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with you. Meanwhile I stayed
on the mountain forty days and forty nights without eating or drinking, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>till the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone
inscribed, by God's own finger, with a copy of all the words that the LORD
spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the
assembly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, at the end of the forty days and forty
nights, when the LORD had given me the two stone tablets of the covenant, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to me, 'Go down from here now, quickly,
for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have become depraved; they
have already turned aside from the way I pointed out to them and have made for
themselves a molten idol. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have seen now how stiff-necked this people
is,' the LORD said to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Let me be, that I may destroy them and blot
out their name from under the heavens. I will then make of you a nation
mightier and greater than they.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When I had come down again from the
blazing, fiery mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in both my hands,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I saw how you had sinned against the LORD, your
God: you had already turned aside from the way which the LORD had pointed out
to you by making for yourselves a molten calf! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Raising the two tablets with both hands I threw
them from me and broke them before your eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, as before, I lay prostrate before the
LORD for forty days and forty nights without eating or drinking, because of all
the sin you had committed in the sight of the LORD and the evil you had done to
provoke him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I dreaded the fierce anger of the LORD
against you: his wrath would destroy you. Yet once again the LORD listened to
me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With Aaron, too, the LORD was deeply angry, and
would have killed him had I not prayed for him also at that time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, taking the calf, the sinful object you
had made, and fusing it with fire, I ground it down to powder as fine as dust,
which I threw into the wadi that went down the mountainside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;At Taberah, at Massah, and at
Kibroth-hattaavah likewise, you provoked the LORD to anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when he sent you up from Kadesh-barnea to
take possession of the land he was giving you, you rebelled against this
command of the LORD, your God, and would not trust or obey him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ever since I have known you, you have been
rebels against the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Those forty days, then, and forty nights,
I lay prostrate before the LORD, because he had threatened to destroy you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This was my prayer to him: O Lord GOD, destroy
not your people, the heritage which your majesty has ransomed and brought out
of Egypt with your strong hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob. Look not upon the stubbornness of this people nor upon their wickedness
and sin, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>lest the people from whose land you have
brought us say, 'The LORD was not able to bring them into the land he promised
them'; or 'Out of hatred for them, he brought them out to slay them in the
desert.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They are, after all, your people and your
heritage, whom you have brought out by your great power and with your
outstretched arm. </p>
