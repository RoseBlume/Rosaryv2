&quot;Cornelius.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He looked intently at him and, seized with
fear, said, &quot;What is it, sir?&quot; He said to him, &quot;Your prayers and
almsgiving have ascended as a memorial offering before God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now send some men to Joppa and summon one Simon

has a house by the sea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the angel who spoke to him had left, he
called two of his servants and a devout soldier <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-41Q href="__PY4.HTM#$41Q">5</a></sup></font></sup> from his
staff, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8

were making preparations he fell into a trance. </p>

Slaughter and eat.&quot; </p>

never have I eaten anything profane and unclean.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The voice spoke to him again, a second time,
&quot;What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This happened three times, and then the object

arrived at the entrance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They called out inquiring whether Simon, who is
called Peter, was staying there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Peter went down to the men and said,

here?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered, &quot;Cornelius, a centurion, an
upright and God-fearing man, respected by the whole Jewish nation, was directed
by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear what you have to
say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he invited them in and showed them
hospitality. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers
from Joppa went with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While he conversed with him, he went in and
found many people gathered together </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to them, &quot;You know that it is
unlawful for a Jewish man to associate with, or visit, a Gentile, but God has

<p class=MsoNormal>29

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Cornelius replied, &quot;Four days ago <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-41W href="__PY4.HTM#$41W">11</a></sup></font></sup>
at this hour, three o'clock in the afternoon, I was at prayer in my house when
suddenly a man in dazzling robes stood before me and said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So I sent for you immediately, and you were

conversion of Cornelius, a Gentile and a &quot;God-fearer&quot; (see the note
on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:26-40). Luke considers the event of
great importance, as is evident from his long treatment of it. The incident is
again related in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY5.HTM#GOSP.ACT.11.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 11:1-18 where Peter is
forced to justify his actions before the Jerusalem community and alluded to in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY9.HTM#GOSP.ACT.15.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 15:7-11 where at the Jerusalem
&quot;Council&quot; Peter supports Paul's missionary activity among the
Gentiles. The narrative divides itself into a series of distinct episodes,
concluding with Peter's presentation of the Christian kerygma
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY5.HTM#GOSP.ACT.11.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 11:4-43) and a pentecostal experience

like Tabitha (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY3.HTM#GOSP.ACT.9.36"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 9:36), Cornelius exemplifies

(see the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:26-40).</p>

conscience (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY4.HTM#GOSP.ACT.10.48"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:48). The necessity of such
instructions to Peter reveals that at first not even the apostles fully grasped
the implications of Jesus' teaching on the law. In Acts, the initial insight
belongs to Stephen.</p>

with the apparition that he invites close personal friends to join him in his
meeting with Peter. But his understanding of the person he is about to meet is
not devoid of superstition, suggested by his falling down before him. For a
similar experience of Paul and Barnabas, see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY8.HTM#GOSP.ACT.14.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts

directed to Luke's Christian readers than to the household of Cornelius, as
indicated by the opening words, &quot;You know.&quot; They trace the continuity
between the preaching and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth and the proclamation of
Jesus by the early community. The emphasis on this divinely ordained continuity
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY4.HTM#GOSP.ACT.10.41"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:41) is meant to assure Luke's readers of

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$421 href="__PY4.HTM#-421">16</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [38] Jesus of Nazareth: God's
revelation of his plan for the destinyof humanity through Israel culminated in
Jesus of Nazareth. Consequently, the ministry of Jesus is an integral part of
God's revelation. This viewpoint explains why the early Christian communities
were interested in conserving the historical substance of the ministry of
Jesus, a tradition leading to the production of the four gospels.</p>

testimony was not restricted to the resurrection of Jesus but also included his
historical ministry. This witness, however, was theological in character; the
Twelve, divinely mandated as prophets, were empowered to interpret his sayings
and deeds in the light of his redemptive death and resurrection. The meaning of
these words and deeds was to be made clear to the developing Christian
community as the bearer of the word of salvation (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.21"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
1:21-26). Hanging him on a tree: see the note on
