<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After mustering the troops he had with him,
David placed officers in command of groups of a thousand and groups of a
hundred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then put a third part of the soldiers
under Joab's command, a third under command of Abishai, son of Zeruiah and
brother of Joab, and a third under command of Ittai the Gittite. The king then
said to the soldiers, &quot;I intend to go out with you myself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they replied: &quot;You must not come out
with us. For if we should flee, we shall not count; even if half of us should
die, we shall not count. You are equal to ten thousand of us. Therefore it is
better that we have you to help us from the city.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king said to them, &quot;I will do what
you think best&quot;; and he stood by the gate as all the soldiers marched out
in units of a hundred and of a thousand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai
and Ittai: &quot;Be gentle with young Absalom for my sake.&quot; All the
soldiers heard the king instruct the various leaders with regard to Absalom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David's army then took the field against
Israel, and a battle was fought in the forest near Mahanaim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The forces of Israel were defeated by David's
servants, and the casualties there that day were heavy - twenty thousand men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The battle spread out over that entire region,
and the thickets consumed more combatants that day than did the sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom unexpectedly came up against David's
servants. He was mounted on a mule, and, as the mule passed under the branches
of a large terebinth, his hair caught fast in the tree. He hung between heaven
and earth while the mule he had been riding ran off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Someone saw this and reported to Joab that he
had seen Absalom hanging from a terebinth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab said to his informant: &quot;If you saw him,
why did you not strike him to the ground on the spot? Then it would have been
my duty to give you fifty pieces of silver and a belt.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the man replied to Joab: &quot;Even if I
already held a thousand pieces of silver in my two hands, I would not harm the
king's son, for the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai in our hearing to
protect the youth Absalom for his sake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Had I been disloyal and killed him, the whole
matter would have come to the attention of the king, and you would stand
aloof.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab replied, &quot;I will not waste time with
you in this way.&quot; And taking three pikes in hand, he thrust for the heart
of Absalom, still hanging from the tree alive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Next, ten of Joab's young armor-bearers closed
in on Absalom, and killed him with further blows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab then sounded the horn, and the soldiers
turned back from the pursuit of the Israelites, because Joab called on them to
halt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom was taken up and cast into a deep pit
in the forest, and a very large mound of stones was erected over him. And all
the Israelites fled to their own tents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar
and erected it for himself in the King's Valley, for he said, &quot;I have no
son to perpetuate my name.&quot; The pillar which he named for himself is
called Yadabshalom to the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, said, &quot;Let me
run to take the good news to the king that the LORD has set him free from the
grasp of his enemies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Joab said to him: &quot;You are not the man
to bring the news today. On some other day you may take the good news, but
today you would not be bringing good news, for in fact the king's son is
dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joab said to a Cushite, &quot;Go, tell the
king what you have seen.&quot; The Cushite bowed to Joab and sped away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Ahimaaz, son of Zadok, said to Joab again,
&quot;Come what may, permit me also to run after the Cushite.&quot; Joab
replied: &quot;Why do you want to run, my son? You will receive no
reward.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he insisted, &quot;Come what may, I want to
run.&quot; Joab said to him, &quot;Very well.&quot; Ahimaaz sped off by way of
the Jordan plain and outran the Cushite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now David was sitting between the two gates,
and a lookout mounted to the roof of the gate above the city wall, where he
looked about and saw a man running all alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The lookout shouted to inform the king, who
said, &quot;If he is alone, he has good news to report.&quot; As he kept coming
nearer, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the lookout spied another runner. From his
place atop the gate he cried out, &quot;There is another man running by himself.&quot;
And the king responded, &quot;He, too, is bringing good news.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the lookout said, &quot;I notice that the
first one runs like Ahimaaz, son of Zadok.&quot; The king replied, &quot;He is
a good man; he comes with good news.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ahimaaz called out and greeted the king.
With face to the ground he paid homage to the king and said, &quot;Blessed be
the LORD your God, who has delivered up the men who rebelled against my lord
the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king asked, &quot;Is the youth Absalom
safe?&quot; And Ahimaaz replied, &quot;I saw a great disturbance when the
king's servant Joab sent your servant on, but I do not know what it was.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king said, &quot;Step aside and remain in
attendance here.&quot; So he stepped aside and remained there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Cushite came in, he said, &quot;Let my
lord the king receive the good news that this day the LORD has taken your part,
freeing you from the grasp of all who rebelled against you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king asked the Cushite, &quot;Is young
Absalom safe?&quot; The Cushite replied, &quot;May the enemies of my lord the
king and all who rebel against you with evil intent be as that young man!&quot;
