registrations of Roman citizens are attested in 28 B.C., 8 B.C., and A.D. 14
and enrollments in individual provinces of those who are not Roman citizens are
also attested, such a universal census of the Roman world under Caesar Augustus
is unknown outside the New Testament. Moreover, there are notorious historical
problems connected with Luke's dating the census when Quirinius was governor of
Syria, and the various attempts to resolve the difficulties have proved
unsuccessful. P. Sulpicius Quirinius became legate of the province of Syria in
A.D. 6-7 when Judea was annexed to the province of Syria. At that time, a
provincial census of Judea was taken up. If Quirinius had been legate of Syria
previously, it would have to have been before 10 B.C. because the various
legates of Syria from 10 B.C. to 4 B.C. (the death of Herod) are known, and
such a dating for an earlier census under Quirinius would create additional
problems for dating the beginning of Jesus' ministry (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWM.HTM#GOSP.LUK.3.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
3:1, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWM.HTM#GOSP.LUK.3.23"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 23). A previous legateship after 4
B.C. (and before A.D. 6) would not fit with the dating of Jesus' birth in the
days of Herod (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWK.HTM#GOSP.LUK.1.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 1:5; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVB.HTM#GOSP.MAT.2.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
2:1). Luke may simply be combining Jesus' birth in Bethlehem with his
vague recollection of a census under Quirinius (see also
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.37"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 5:37) to underline the significance of this

the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus is usually dated from 27 B.C. to his death in
A.D. 14. According to Greek inscriptions, Augustus was regarded in the Roman
Empire as &quot;savior&quot; and &quot;god,&quot; and he was credited with
establishing a time of peace, the pax Augusta, throughout the Roman world
during his long reign. It is not by chance that Luke relates the birth of Jesus
to the time of Caesar Augustus: the real savior (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWL.HTM#GOSP.LUK.2.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke

infancy narrative is contained in the angel's announcement: this child is
savior, Messiah, and Lord. Luke is the only synoptic gospel writer to use the
title savior for Jesus (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWL.HTM#GOSP.LUK.2.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 2:11;

savior, Jesus is looked upon by Luke as the one who rescues humanity from sin
and delivers humanity from the condition of alienation from God. The title
christos, &quot;Christ,&quot; is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew masiah,
&quot;Messiah,&quot; &quot;anointed one.&quot; Among certain groups in
first-century Palestinian Judaism, the title was applied to an expected royal
leader from the line of David who would restore the kingdom to Israel (see
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:6). The political overtones of the title are
played down in Luke and instead the Messiah of the Lord

2:29-32). Lord is the most frequently used title for Jesus in Luke
and Acts. In the New Testament it is also applied to Yahweh, as it is in the
Old Testament. When used of Jesus it points to his transcendence and dominion
over humanity.</p>

syntactically, their must refer to Mary and Joseph, even though the Mosaic law
never mentions the purification of the husband. Recognizing the problem, some
Western scribes have altered the text to read &quot;his purification,&quot;
understanding the presentation of Jesus in the temple as a form of
purification; the Vulgate version has a Latin form that could be either
&quot;his&quot; or &quot;her.&quot; According to the Mosaic law
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P2Y.HTM#PENT.LEV.12.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Lev 12:2-8), the woman who gives birth to a boy
is unable for forty days to touch anything sacred or to enter the temple area
by reason of her legal impurity. At the end of this period she is required to
offer a year-old lamb as a burnt offering and a turtledove or young pigeon as
an expiation of sin. The woman who could not afford a lamb offered instead two
turtledoves or two young pigeons, as Mary does here. They took him up to
Jerusalem to present him to the Lord: as the firstborn son
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWL.HTM#GOSP.LUK.2.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 2:7) Jesus was consecrated to the Lord as the
law required (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P1U.HTM#PENT.EXO.13.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 13:2,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P1U.HTM#PENT.EXO.13.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 12), but there was no requirement that this be
done at the temple. The concept of a presentation at the temple is probably
derived from <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P6V.HTM#HIS.1SAM.1.24"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Sam 1:24-28, where Hannah offers

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P3H.HTM#PENT.NUM.3.47"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Numbers 3:47-48) that the firstborn son should be
redeemed by the parents through their payment of five shekels to a member of a
priestly family. About this legal requirement Luke is silent.</p>

Israel: Simeon here and later Anna who speak about the child to all who were

an incident from Jesus' youth is unique in the canonical gospel tradition. It

precedence over his ties to his family.</p>
