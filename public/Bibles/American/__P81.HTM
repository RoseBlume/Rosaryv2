<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QU href="__P81.HTM#$QU">1</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD sent Nathan to David, and when he
came to him, he said: &quot;Judge this case for me! In a certain town there
were two men, one rich, the other poor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rich man had flocks and herds in great
numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the poor man had nothing at all except one
little ewe lamb that he had bought. He nourished her, and she grew up with him
and his children. She shared the little food he had and drank from his cup and
slept in his bosom. She was like a daughter to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, the rich man received a visitor, but he
would not take from his own flocks and herds to prepare a meal for the wayfarer
who had come to him. Instead he took the poor man's ewe lamb and made a meal of
it for his visitor.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David grew very angry with that man and said to
Nathan: &quot;As the LORD lives, the man who has done this merits death! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He shall restore the ewe lamb fourfold because
he has done this and has had no pity.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Nathan said to David: &quot;You are the
man! Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'I anointed you king of Israel. I
rescued you from the hand of Saul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I gave you your lord's house and your lord's
wives for your own. I gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this
were not enough, I could count up for you still more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why have you spurned the LORD and done evil in
his sight? You have cut down Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you took his
wife as your own, and him you killed with the sword of the Ammonites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart
from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah
to be your wife.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the LORD: 'I will bring evil upon you
out of your own house. I will take your wives while you live to see it, and
will give them to your neighbor. He shall lie with your wives in broad
daylight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have done this deed in secret, but I will
bring it about in the presence of all Israel, and with the sun looking
down.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to Nathan, &quot;I have sinned
against the LORD.&quot; Nathan answered David: &quot;The LORD on his part has
forgiven your sin: you shall not die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But since you have utterly spurned the LORD by
this deed, the child born to you must surely die.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Nathan returned to his house. The LORD
struck the child that the wife of Uriah had borne to David, and it became
desperately ill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David besought God for the child. He kept a
fast, retiring for the night to lie on the ground clothed in sackcloth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The elders of his house stood beside him urging
him to rise from the ground; but he would not, nor would he take food with
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the seventh day, the child died. David's
servants, however, were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they
said: &quot;When the child was alive, we spoke to him, but he would not listen
to what we said. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do some
harm!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David noticed his servants whispering among
themselves and realized that the child was dead. He asked his servants,
&quot;Is the child dead?&quot; They replied, &quot;Yes, he is.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rising from the ground, David washed and
anointed himself, and changed his clothes. Then he went to the house of the
LORD and worshiped. He returned to his own house, where at his request food was
set before him, and he ate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servants said to him: &quot;What is this
you are doing? While the child was living, you fasted and wept and kept vigil;
now that the child is dead, you rise and take food.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He replied: &quot;While the child was living, I
fasted and wept, thinking, 'Perhaps the LORD will grant me the child's life.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I
bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He
went and slept with her; and she conceived and bore him a son, who was named
Solomon. The LORD loved him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and sent the prophet Nathan to name him
Jedidiah, on behalf of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and
captured this royal city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent messengers to David with the word:
&quot;I have fought against Rabbah and have taken the water-city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, assemble the rest of the soldiers,
join the siege against the city and capture it, lest it be I that capture the
city and it be credited to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David assembled the rest of the soldiers and
went to Rabbah. When he had fought against it and captured it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QV href="__P81.HTM#$QV">2</a></sup></font></sup> he took the crown from Milcom's head. It
weighed a talent, of gold and precious stones; it was placed on David's head.
He brought out immense booty from the city, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and also led away the inhabitants, whom he
assigned to work with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, or put to work at the
brickmold. This is what he did to all the Ammonite cities. David and all the
soldiers then returned to Jerusalem. </p>
