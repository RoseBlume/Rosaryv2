promised rest is found only in the New Testament (Hebrews 3-4). </p>

man: the words &quot;with devotion,&quot; not in the Hebrew, are added for the
sense. No fully satisfactory explanation has been given this text. Among the
more probable are these: (a) Formerly the man (the Lord) encompassed the woman
(Israel) with mercy and devotion; now in the spiritual religion of Israel which
will follow on the restoration, this order will be reversed. (b) So secure will
Israel be after the restoration that women will no longer need the natural
protection of their husbands, but even weak women can protect men. (c) St.
Jerome in his commentary on this verse understood it of Mary's virginal
conception of Christ. &quot;The LORD has created a new thing on earth; without
seed of man, without carnal union and conception, &quot;a woman will encompass
a man' within her womb-One who, though He will later appear to advance in
wisdom and age through the stages of infancy and childhood, yet, while confined
for the usual number of months in his mother's womb, will already be perfect
man.&quot;</p>

to Jeremiah, the qualities of the new covenant that make it different from the
old are: (a) It will not be broken, but will last forever; (b) Its law will be
written in the heart, not merely on tablets of stone; (c) The knowledge of God
will be so generally shown forth in the life of the people that it will no
longer be necessary to put it into words of instruction. In the fullest sense,
this prophecy was fulfilled only through the work of Jesus Christ; cf
