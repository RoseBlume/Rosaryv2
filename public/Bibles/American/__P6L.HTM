<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NL href="__P6L.HTM#$NL">1</a></sup></font></sup> At that time there was no king in Israel.
Moreover the tribe of Danites were in search of a district to dwell in, for up
to that time they had received no heritage among the tribes of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the Danites sent from their clan a detail of
five valiant men of Zorah and Eshtaol, to reconnoiter the land and scout it.
With their instructions to go and scout the land, they traveled as far as the
house of Micah in the mountain region of Ephraim, where they passed the night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NM href="__P6L.HTM#$NM">2</a></sup></font></sup> Near the house of Micah, they recognized the
voice of the young Levite and turned in that direction. &quot;Who brought you
here and what are you doing here?&quot; they asked him. &quot;What is your
interest here?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This is how Micah treats me,&quot; he
replied to them. &quot;He pays me a salary and I am his priest.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to him, &quot;Consult God, that we
may know whether the undertaking we are engaged in will succeed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priest said to them, &quot;Go and prosper:
the LORD is favorable to the undertaking you are engaged in.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the five men went on and came to Laish. They
saw that the people dwelling there lived securely after the manner of the
Sidonians, quiet and trusting, with no lack of any natural resources. They were
distant from the Sidonians and had no contact with other people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the five returned to their kinsmen in
Zorah and Eshtaol and were asked for a report, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they replied, &quot;Come, let us attack them,
for we have seen the land and it is very good. Are you going to hesitate? Do
not be slothful about beginning your expedition to possess the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those against whom you go are a trusting
people, and the land is ample. God has indeed given it into your power: a place
where no natural resource is lacking.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So six hundred men of the clan of the Danites,
fully armed with weapons of war, set out from where they were in Zorah and
Eshtaol, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and camped in Judah, up near Kiriath-jearim; hence
to this day the place, which lies west of Kiriath-jearim, is called
Mahaneh-dan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From there they went on to the mountain region
of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The five men who had gone to reconnoiter the
land of Laish said to their kinsmen, &quot;Do you know that in these houses
there are an ephod, household idols, and a carved idol overlaid with silver?
Now decide what you must do!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So turning in that direction, they went to the
house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and greeted him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The six hundred men girt with weapons of war,
who were Danites, stood by the entrance of the gate, and the priest stood there
also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the five men who had gone to
reconnoiter the land went up and entered the house of Micah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had gone in and taken the ephod, the
household idols, and the carved idol overlaid with silver, the priest said to
them, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to him, &quot;Be still: put your hand
over your mouth. Come with us and be our father and priest. Is it better for
you to be priest for the family of one man or to be priest for a tribe and a
clan in Israel?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priest, agreeing, took the ephod, household
idols, and carved idol and went off in the midst of the band. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they turned to depart, they placed their
little ones, their livestock, and their goods at the head of the column. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Danites had already gone some distance,
when those in the houses near that of Micah took up arms and overtook them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They called to the Danites, who turned about
and said to Micah, &quot;What do you want, that you have taken up arms?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have taken my god, which I made, and
have gone off with my priest as well,&quot; he answered. &quot;What is left for
me? How, then, can you ask me what I want?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Danites said to him, &quot;Let us hear no
further sound from you, lest fierce men fall upon you and you and your family
lose your lives.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Danites then went on their way, and Micah,
seeing that they were stronger than he, returned home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Having taken what Micah had made, and the
priest he had had, they attacked Laish, a quiet and trusting people; they put
them to the sword and destroyed their city by fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No one came to their aid, since the city was
far from Sidon and they had no contact with other people. The Danites then
rebuilt the city, which was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob, and lived
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, son
of Israel. However, the name of the city was formerly Laish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NN href="__P6L.HTM#$NN">3</a></sup></font></sup> The Danites set up the carved idol for
themselves, and Jonathan, son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his descendants
were priests for the tribe of the Danites until the time of the captivity of
the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They maintained the carved idol Micah had made
as long as the house of God was in Shiloh. </p>
