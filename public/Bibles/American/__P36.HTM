<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Tell the Israelites: Anyone, whether an
Israelite or an alien residing in Israel, who gives any of his offspring to
Molech shall be put to death. Let his fellow citizens stone him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I myself will turn against such a man and cut
him off from the body of his people; for in giving his offspring to Molech, he
has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even if his fellow citizens connive at such a
man's crime of giving his offspring to Molech, and fail to put him to death, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I myself will set my face against that man and
his family and will cut off from their people both him and all who join him in
his wanton worship of Molech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Should anyone turn to mediums and
fortune-tellers and follow their wanton ways, I will turn against such a one
and cut him off from his people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sanctify yourselves, then, and be holy; for I,
the LORD, your God, am holy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Be careful, therefore, to observe what I, the
LORD, who make you holy, have prescribed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Anyone who curses his father or mother
shall be put to death; since he has cursed his father or mother, he has
forfeited his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man commits adultery with his neighbor's

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of
them shall be put to death; since they have committed an abhorrent deed, they
have forfeited their lives. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both
of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited
their lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man marries a woman and her mother also,
the man and the two women as well shall be burned to death for their shameful
conduct, so that such shamefulness may not be found among you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man consummates marriage with his sister
or his half-sister, they shall be publicly cut off from their people for this
shameful deed; the man shall pay the penalty of having had intercourse with his
own sister. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man lies in sexual intercourse with a
woman during her menstrual period, both of them shall be cut off from their
people, because they have laid bare the flowing fountain of her blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall not have intercourse with your
mother's sister or your father's sister; whoever does so shall pay the penalty
of incest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man disgraces his uncle by having
intercourse with his uncle's wife, the man and his aunt shall pay the penalty
by dying childless. </p>

you out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not conform, therefore, to the customs of
the nations whom I am driving out of your way, because all these things that
they have done have filled me with disgust for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But to you I have said: Their land shall be
your possession, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am giving it to you as
your own, I, the LORD, your God, who have set you apart from the other nations.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You, too, must set apart, then, the clean
animals from the unclean, and the clean birds from the unclean, so that you may
not be contaminated with the uncleanness of any beast or bird or of any
swarming creature in the land that I have set apart for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To me, therefore, you shall be sacred; for I,
the LORD, am sacred, I, who have set you apart from the other nations to be my
