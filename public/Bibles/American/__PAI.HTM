<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David assembled at Jerusalem all the leaders of
Israel, the heads of the tribes, the commanders of the divisions who were in
the service of the king, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, the
overseers of all the king's estates and possessions, and his sons, together
with the courtiers, the warriors, and every important man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-VV href="__PAI.HTM#$VV">1</a></sup></font></sup> King David rose to his feet and said:
&quot;Hear me, my brethren and my people. It was my purpose to build a house of
repose myself for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, the footstool for the
feet of our God; and I was preparing to build it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But God said to me, 'You may not build a house
in my honor, for you are a man who fought wars and shed blood.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me
from all my father's family to be king over Israel forever. For he chose Judah
as leader, then one family of Judah, that of my father; and finally, among all
the sons of my father, it pleased him to make me king over all Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And of all my sons - for the LORD has given me
many sons - he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the LORD'S royal throne over
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For he said to me: 'It is your son Solomon who
shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him for my son, and I
will be a father to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will establish his kingdom forever, if he
perseveres in keeping my commandments and decrees as he keeps them now.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, in the presence of all Israel, the
assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, I exhort you to keep and
to carry out all the commandments of the LORD, your God, that you may continue
to possess this good land and afterward leave it as an inheritance to your
children forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;As for you, Solomon, my son, know the God
of your father and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing soul, for the
LORD searches all hearts and understands all the mind's thoughts. If you seek
him, he will let himself be found by you; but if you abandon him, he will cast
you off forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See, then! The LORD has chosen you to build a
house as his sanctuary. Take courage and set to work.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David gave to his son Solomon the pattern
of the portico and of the building itself, with its storerooms, its upper rooms
and inner chambers, and the room with the propitiatory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He provided also the pattern for all else that
he had in mind by way of courts for the house of the LORD, with the surrounding
compartments for the stores for the house of God and the stores of the votive
offerings, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as well as for the divisions of the priests and
Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all
the liturgical vessels of the house of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He specified the weight of gold to be used in
the golden vessels for the various services and the weight of silver to be used
in the silver vessels for the various services; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>likewise for the golden lampstands and their
lamps he specified the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, and for
the silver lampstands he specified the weight of silver for each lampstand and
its lamps, depending on the use to which each lampstand was to be put. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He specified the weight of gold for each table to
hold the showbread, and the silver for the silver tables; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the pure gold to be used for the forks and
pitchers; the amount of gold for each golden bowl and the silver for each
silver bowl; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-VW href="__PAI.HTM#$VW">2</a></sup></font></sup> the refined gold, and its weight, to be used
for the altar of incense; and, finally, gold for what would suggest a chariot
throne: the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the
covenant of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had successfully committed to writing the
exact specifications of the pattern, because the hand of the LORD was upon him.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to his son Solomon: &quot;Be
firm and steadfast; go to work without fear or discouragement, for the LORD
God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or abandon you before you have
completed all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The classes of the priests and Levites are
ready for all the service of the house of God; they will help you in all your
work with all those who are eager to show their skill in every kind of
craftsmanship. Also the leaders and all the people will do everything that you
command.&quot; </p>
