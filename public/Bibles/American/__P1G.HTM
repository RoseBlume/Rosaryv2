<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 50</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph threw himself on his father's face and
wept over him as he kissed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he ordered the physicians in his service
to embalm his father. When they embalmed Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they spent forty days at it, for that is the
full period of embalming; and the Egyptians mourned him for seventy days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When that period of mourning was over, Joseph
spoke to Pharaoh's courtiers. &quot;Please do me this favor,&quot; he said,
&quot;and convey to Pharaoh this request of mine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since my father, at the point of death, made me
promise on oath to bury him in the tomb that he had prepared for himself in the
land of Canaan, may I go up there to bury my father and then come back?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh replied, &quot;Go and bury your father,
as he made you promise on oath.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Joseph left to bury his father; and with him
went all of Pharaoh's officials who were senior members of his court and all
the other dignitaries of Egypt, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as well as Joseph's whole household, his
brothers, and his father's household; only their children and their flocks and
herds were left in the region of Goshen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Chariots, too, and charioteers went up with
him; it was a very large retinue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6V href="__P1G.HTM#$6V">1</a></sup></font></sup> When they arrived at Goren-ha-atad, which is
beyond the Jordan, they held there a very great and solemn memorial service;
and Joseph observed seven days of mourning for his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Canaanites who inhabited the land saw
the mourning at Goren-ha-atad, they said, &quot;This is a solemn funeral the
Egyptians are having.&quot; That is why the place was named Abel-mizraim. It is
beyond the Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Jacob's sons did for him as he had
instructed them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They carried him to the land of Canaan and
buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, facing on Mamre, the field
that Abraham had bought for a burial ground from Ephron the Hittite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After Joseph had buried his father he returned
to Egypt, together with his brothers and all who had gone up with him for the
burial of his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now that their father was dead, Joseph's
brothers became fearful and thought, &quot;Suppose Joseph has been nursing a
grudge against us and now plans to pay us back in full for all the wrong we did
him!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they approached Joseph and said:
&quot;Before your father died, he gave us these instructions: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'You shall say to Joseph, Jacob begs you to
forgive the criminal wrongdoing of your brothers, who treated you so cruelly.'
Please, therefore, forgive the crime that we, the servants of your father's
God, committed.&quot; When they spoke these words to him, Joseph broke into
tears. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then his brothers proceeded to fling themselves
down before him and said, &quot;Let us be your slaves!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Joseph replied to them: &quot;Have no fear.
Can I take the place of God? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even though you meant harm to me, God meant it
for good, to achieve his present end, the survival of many people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore have no fear. I will provide for you
and for your children.&quot; By thus speaking kindly to them, he reassured
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph remained in Egypt, together with his
father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He saw Ephraim's children to the third
generation, and the children of Manasseh's son Machir were also born on
Joseph's knees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph said to his brothers: &quot;I am about
to die. God will surely take care of you and lead you out of this land to the
land that he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, putting the sons of Israel under oath, he
continued, &quot;When God thus takes care of you, you must bring my bones up
with you from this place.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. He
was embalmed and laid to rest in a coffin in Egypt. </p>

&quot;Threshing Floor of the Brambles.&quot; Abel-mizraim: although the name
really means &quot;watercourse of the Egyptians,&quot; it is understood here,
by a play on the first part of the term, to mean &quot;mourning of the Egyptians.&quot;
The site has not been identified through either reading of the name. But it is
difficult to see why the mourning rites should have been held in the land
beyond the Jordan when the burial was at Hebron. Perhaps an earlier form of the
story placed the mourning rites beyond the Wadi of Egypt, the traditional
boundary between Canaan and Egypt (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4C.HTM#PENT.NUM.34.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Numbers 34:5;
