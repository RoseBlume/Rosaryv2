<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Son of man, speak thus to your countrymen: When
I bring the sword against a country, and the people of this country select one
of their number to be their watchman, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the watchman, seeing the sword coming
against the country, blows the trumpet to warn the people, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>anyone hearing but not heeding the warning of
the trumpet and therefore slain by the sword that comes against him, shall be
responsible for his own death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He heard the trumpet blast yet refused to take
warning; he is responsible for his own death, for had he taken warning he would
have escaped with his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if the watchman sees the sword coming and
fails to blow the warning trumpet, so that the sword comes and takes anyone, I
will hold the watchman responsible for that person's death, even though that
person is taken because of his own sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You, son of man, I have appointed watchman for
the house of Israel; when you hear me say anything, you shall warn them for me.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If I tell the wicked man that he shall surely
die, and you do not speak out to dissuade the wicked man from his way, he (the
wicked man) shall die for his guilt, but I will hold you responsible for his
death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you warn the wicked man, trying to turn
him from his way, and he refuses to turn from his way, he shall die for his
guilt, but you shall save yourself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, son of man, speak to the house of
Israel: You people say, &quot;Our crimes and our sins weigh us down; we are
rotting away because of them. How can we survive?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Answer them: As I live, says the Lord GOD, I
swear I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, but rather in the
wicked man's conversion, that he may live. Turn, turn from your evil ways! Why
should you die, O house of Israel? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, son of man, tell your countrymen:
The virtue which a man has practiced will not save him on the day that he sins;
neither will the wickedness that a man has done bring about his downfall on the
day that he turns from his wickedness (nor can the virtuous man, when he sins,
remain alive). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though I say to the virtuous man that he shall
surely live, if he then presumes on his virtue and does wrong, none of his
virtuous deeds shall be remembered; because of the wrong he has done, he shall
die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And though I say to the wicked man that he
shall surely die, if he turns away from his sin and does what is right and
just, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>giving back pledges, restoring stolen goods,
living by the statutes that bring life, and doing no wrong, he shall surely
live, he shall not die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>None of the sins he committed shall be held
against him; he has done what is right and just, he shall surely live. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet your countrymen say, &quot;The way of the
LORD is not fair!&quot;; but it is their way that is not fair. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When a virtuous man turns away from what is
right and does wrong, he shall die for it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when a wicked man turns away from
wickedness and does what is right and just, because of this he shall live. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And still you say, &quot;The way of the LORD is
not fair!&quot;? I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house
of Israel. </p>

According to Jeremiah (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSB.HTM#PROPHB.EZE.39.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Ezekiel 39:2), Jerusalem
was taken in July, 587. Some MSS read &quot;eleventh&quot; for twelfth year
(January, 586); even so, there was ample time between the fall of Jerusalem and
the arrival of the fugitive from that city to journey to Babylon. However, this
is the fugitive sent to fulfill the promise of <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PRW.HTM#PROPHB.EZE.24.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Ezekiel 24:25,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PRW.HTM#PROPHB.EZE.24.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 27, the eye witness who would release Ezekiel
from his dumbness; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PRB.HTM#PROPHB.EZE.3.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Ezekiel 3:26-27. </p>

rejects the idea that the survivors in Judah have any claim to the land. The
new Israel is to be formed from the exiles.</p>
