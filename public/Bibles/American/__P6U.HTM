<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>The Historical
Books</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
historical books include 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles,
Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 and 2 Maccabees. To these are added the special literary
group of Tobit, Judith, and Esther. </p>

<p>The Books of Tobit, Judith,
and 1 and 2 Maccabees, as well as parts of Esther, are called deuterocanonical:
they are not contained in the Hebrew canon but have been accepted by the
Catholic Church as canonical and inspired.</p>

<p>By means of a series of
episodes involving the persons of Samuel, Saul, and David, a century of history
unfolds in 1 and 2 Samuel from the close of the period of Judges to the rise
and establishment of the monarchy in Israel. Most important is God's promise to
David of a lasting dynasty (2 Sam 7), from which royal messianism in the Bible
developed.</p>

<p>In 1 and 2 Kings the
religious history of Israel extends another four centuries, from the last days
of David to the Babylonian captivity and the destruction of Jerusalem (587
B.C.). The various sources for these books are woven into a uniform pattern
based on the principle of fidelity to Yahweh for rulers and people alike. The
sequence of regnal chronicles in both books is interrupted by a cycle of
traditions surrounding the prophets Elijah (1 Kings) and Elisha (2 Kings).</p>

<p>Chronicles, Ezra, and
Nehemiah form a historical work, uniform in style and basic ideas. Chronicles
records the long period from the reign of Saul to the return from exile, not so
much with exactitude of detail as with concern for the meaning of the facts
which demonstrate God's intervention in history. The Ezra-Nehemiah chronicle
constitutes the most important source for the formation of the Jewish religious
community after the Babylonian exile; the two persons most responsible for the
reorganization of Jewish life were Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>

<p>1 and 2
Maccabees contain independent accounts of partially identical events which
accompanied the attempted suppression of Judaism in Palestine in the second
century B.C. Vigorous reaction to this attempt established for a time the
religious and political independence of the Jews. 1 Maccabees portrays God as
the eternal benefactor of the Jews and their unfailing source of help. The
people are required to be devoted to his exclusive worship and to observe
exactly the law he has given them. 2 Maccabees, besides supplementing the
former volume, gives a theological interpretation of the history of the period
and contains teaching on the resurrection from the dead, intercession of the
saints, and suffrages for the dead.</p>

<p>Tobit, Judith, and Esther
are examples of free composition - the religious novel used for purposes of
edification and instruction. Interest in whatever historical data these books
may contain is merely intensified by the addition of vivid details. Judith is a
lesson in Providence: a pious reflection on the annual Passover observance to
convey the reassurance that God is still the master of history who saves Israel
from her enemies. Esther's purpose is the glorification of the Jewish people and
the explanation of the origin, significance, and date of the feast of Purim. It
is a literary development of the principle of reversal of fortune through
punishment of the prosperous rich and reward for the virtuous who are
oppressed.</p>

<p>Samuel to Maccabees demonstrates
that before as well as during the millennium of history with which it is
concerned, Israel was a covenanted people, bound to Yahweh, Lord of the
universe, by the ties of faith and obedience. This required observance of the
law and worship in his temple, the consequent rewards of which were divine
favor and protection. In this way these books anticipate and prepare for the
coming of him who would bring type and prophecy to fulfillment, history to
term, and holiness to perfection: Christ, the Son of David and the promised
Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>The
Books of Samuel</i></b></p>

<p>Originally but one book,
the scroll of Samuel was early divided into two. The Greek translators called
these the first and second Books of Kingdoms, a title St. Jerome later modified
to &quot;Kings.&quot; The Hebrew title, &quot;Samuel&quot; alludes to the
leading figure in the first book, who was responsible for the enthronement of
David. It is David's history that the second book recounts. </p>

<p>This sacred work thus
comprises the history of about a century, describing the close of the age of
the Judges and the beginnings of monarchy in Israel under Saul and David. It is
not a complete and continuous history, nor a systematic account of the period,
but rather a series of episodes centered around the persons of Samuel, Saul and
David, the principal figures leading up to the establishment of the royal
dynasty of David.</p>

<p>The final editor is
unknown, nor are we certain of the time at which the various strands of the
narrative were put together, though one may think of the period, perhaps late
in the seventh century B.C., when the other volumes of the &quot;Former
Prophets&quot; from Joshua through Kings, were built into a more or less
continuous historical corpus. The Samuel-Saul-David narratives clearly depend
on several written sources: a Samuel cycle, two sets of stories about Saul and
David, and a family history of David. This last (2 Sam 9-20; 1 Kings 1-2), one
of the most vivid historical narratives surviving from ancient times, probably
originated early in the reign of Solomon.</p>

<p>One of the most significant
theological contributions of the Old Testament is found in 2 Sam 7 the oracle
of Nathan. David is here promised an eternal dynasty, and this becomes the
basis for the development of royal messianism throughout the Bible. With this promise
to David one should compare 2 Chron 17; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PI9.HTM#WISDB.PSA.89.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm
