<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12O href="__PDU.HTM#$12O">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the year one hundred and fifty-one,
Demetrius, son of Seleucus, set out from Rome, arrived with a few men in a city
on the seacoast, and began to rule there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he was preparing to enter the royal palace
of his ancestors, the soldiers seized Antiochus and Lysias to bring them to
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he was informed of this, he said, &quot;Do
not show me their faces.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the soldiers killed them, and Demetrius sat
on the royal throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12P href="__PDU.HTM#$12P">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then all the lawless and impious men of Israel
came to him. They were led by Alcimus, who desired to be high priest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They made this accusation to the king against
the people: &quot;Judas and his brothers have destroyed all your friends and
have driven us out of our country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So now, send a man whom you trust to go and see
all the havoc Judas has done to us and to the king's land, and let him punish
them and all their supporters.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king chose Bacchides, one of the
King's Friends, governor of West-of-Euphrates, a great man in the kingdom, and
faithful to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent him and the impious Alcimus, to whom he
granted the high priesthood, with orders to take revenge on the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They set out and, on arriving in the land of
Judah with a great army, sent messengers who spoke deceitfully to Judas and his
brothers in peaceful terms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But these paid no attention to their words,
seeing that they had come with a great army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A group of scribes, however, gathered about
Alcimus and Bacchides to ask for a just agreement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Hasideans were the first among the
Israelites to seek peace with them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for they said, &quot;A priest of the line of
Aaron has come with the army, and he will not do us any wrong.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He spoke with them peacefully and swore to
them, &quot;We will not try to injure you or your friends.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they trusted him. But he arrested sixty of
them and killed them in one day, according to the text of Scripture: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The flesh of your saints they have
strewn, and their blood they have shed round about Jerusalem, and there was no
one to bury them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then fear and dread of them came upon all the
people, who said: &quot;There is no truth or justice among them; they violated
the agreement and the oath that they swore.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12Q href="__PDU.HTM#$12Q">3</a></sup></font></sup> Bacchides withdrew from Jerusalem and pitched
his camp in Beth-zaith. He had many of the men arrested who deserted to him,
throwing them into the great pit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He handed the province over to Alcimus, leaving
troops to help him, while he himself returned to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Alcimus spared no pains to maintain his high
priesthood, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and all those who were disturbing their people
gathered about him. They took possession of the land of Judah and caused great
distress in Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Judas saw all the evils that Alcimus and
his men were bringing upon the Israelites, more than even the Gentiles had
done, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he went about all the borders of Judea and took
revenge on the men who had deserted, preventing them from going out into the
country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when Alcimus saw that Judas and his
followers were gaining strength and realized that he could not oppose them, he
returned to the king and accused them of grave crimes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his famous
officers, who was a bitter enemy of Israel, with orders to destroy the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12R href="__PDU.HTM#$12R">4</a></sup></font></sup> Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a large force
and deceitfully sent to Judas and his brothers this peaceable message: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Let there be no fight between me and you.
I will come with a few men to meet you peaceably.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he came to Judas, and they greeted one
another peaceably. But Judas' enemies were prepared to seize him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he became aware that Nicanor had come to
him with treachery in mind, Judas was afraid and would not meet him again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12S href="__PDU.HTM#$12S">5</a></sup></font></sup> When Nicanor saw that his plan had been
discovered, he went out to fight Judas near Capharsalama. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About five hundred men of Nicanor's army fell;
the rest fled to the City of David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some
of the priests from the sanctuary and some of the elders of the people came out
to greet him peaceably and to show him the holocaust that was being offered for
the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12T href="__PDU.HTM#$12T">6</a></sup></font></sup> But he mocked and ridiculed them, defiled
them, and spoke disdainfully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In a rage he swore: &quot;If Judas and his army
are not delivered to me at once, when I return victorious I will burn this
temple down.&quot; He went away in great anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priests, however, went in and stood before
the altar and the sanctuary. They wept and said: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have chosen this house to bear your
name, to be a house of prayer and petition for your people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take revenge on this man and his army, and let
them fall by the sword. Remember their blasphemies, and do not let them
continue.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nicanor left Jerusalem and pitched his camp at
Beth-horon, where the Syrian army joined him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12U href="__PDU.HTM#$12U">7</a></sup></font></sup> But Judas camped in Adasa with three thousand
men. Here Judas uttered this prayer: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When they who were sent by the king
blasphemed, your angel went out and killed a hundred and eighty-five thousand
of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the same way, crush this army before us
today, and let the rest know that Nicanor spoke wickedly against your
sanctuary; judge him according to his wickedness.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The armies met in battle on the thirteenth day
of the month Adar. Nicanor's army was crushed, and he himself was the first to
fall in the battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his army saw that Nicanor was dead, they
threw down their arms and fled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews pursued them a day's journey, from
Adasa to near Gazara, blowing the trumpets behind them as signals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From all the surrounding villages of Judea
people came out and closed in on them. They hemmed them in, and all the enemies
fell by the sword; not a single one escaped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the Jews collected the spoils and the
booty; they cut off Nicanor's head and his right arm, which he had lifted up so
arrogantly. These they brought to Jerusalem and displayed there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people rejoiced greatly, and observed that
day as a great festival. </p>
