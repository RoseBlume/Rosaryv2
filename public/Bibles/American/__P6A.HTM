<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning Jerubbaal (that is,
Gideon) encamped by Enharod with all his soldiers. The camp of Midian was in
the valley north of Gibeath-hammoreh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;You have too
many soldiers with you for me to deliver Midian into their power, lest Israel
vaunt itself against me and say, 'My own power brought me the victory.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now proclaim to all the soldiers, 'If anyone is
afraid or fearful, let him leave.'&quot; When Gideon put them to this test on
the mountain, twenty-two thousand of the soldiers left, but ten thousand
remained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;There are still
too many soldiers. Lead them down to the water and I will test them for you
there. If I tell you that a certain man is to go with you, he must go with you.
But no one is to go if I tell you he must not.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MV href="__P6A.HTM#$MV">1</a></sup></font></sup> When Gideon led the soldiers down to the
water, the LORD said to him, &quot;You shall set to one side everyone who laps
up the water as a dog does with its tongue; to the other, everyone who kneels
down to drink.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those who lapped up the water raised to their
mouths by hand numbered three hundred, but all the rest of the soldiers knelt
down to drink the water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;By means of the
three hundred who lapped up the water I will save you and will deliver Midian
into your power. So let all the other soldiers go home.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their horns, and such supplies as the soldiers
had with them, were taken up, and Gideon ordered the rest of the Israelites to
their tents, but kept the three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was beneath
him in the valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That night the LORD said to Gideon, &quot;Go,
descend on the camp, for I have delivered it up to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you are afraid to attack, go down to the
camp with your aide Purah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you hear what they are saying, you will
have the courage to descend on the camp.&quot; So he went down with his aide
Purah to the outposts of the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Midianites, Amalekites, and all the
Kedemites lay in the valley, as numerous as locusts. Nor could their camels be
counted, for these were as many as the sands on the seashore. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MW href="__P6A.HTM#$MW">2</a></sup></font></sup> When Gideon arrived, one man was telling
another about a dream. &quot;I had a dream,&quot; he said, &quot;that a round
loaf of barley bread was rolling into the camp of Midian. It came to our tent
and struck it, and as it fell it turned the tent upside down.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This can only be the sword of the
Israelite Gideon, son of Joash,&quot; the other replied. &quot;God has
delivered Midian and all the camp into his power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Gideon heard the description and
explanation of the dream, he prostrated himself. Then returning to the camp of
Israel, he said, &quot;Arise, for the LORD has delivered the camp of Midian
into your power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He divided the three hundred men into three
companies, and provided them all with horns and with empty jars and torches
inside the jars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Watch me and follow my lead,&quot; he
told them. &quot;I shall go to the edge of the camp, and as I do, you must do
also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I and those with me blow horns, you too
must blow horns all around the camp and cry out, 'For the LORD and for
Gideon!'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MX href="__P6A.HTM#$MX">3</a></sup></font></sup> So Gideon and the hundred men who were with
him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just
after the posting of the guards. They blew the horns and broke the jars they
were holding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All three companies blew horns and broke their
jars. They held the torches in their left hands, and in their right the horns
they were blowing, and cried out, &quot;A sword for the LORD and Gideon!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They all remained standing in place around the
camp, while the whole camp fell to running and shouting and fleeing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the three hundred men kept blowing the
horns, and throughout the camp the LORD set the sword of one against another.
The army fled as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zarethan, near the
border of Abel-meholah at Tabbath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites were called to arms from
Naphtali, from Asher, and from all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon also sent messengers throughout the
mountain region of Ephraim to say, &quot;Go down to confront Midian, and seize
the water courses against them as far as Beth-barah, as well as the
Jordan.&quot; So all the Ephraimites were called to arms, and they seized the
water courses as far as Beth-barah, and the Jordan as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb
and Zeeb, killing Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb.
Then they pursued Midian and carried the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon
beyond the Jordan. </p>
