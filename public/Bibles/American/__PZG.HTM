section of the letter is devoted to regulation of conduct at the liturgy. The
problems Paul handles have to do with the dress of women in the assembly
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:3-16), improprieties in the celebration

<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:2 introduces all of these discussions,
but applies more appropriately to the second (cf the mention of praise in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:17 and of tradition in

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4C6 href="__PZG.HTM#-4C6">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3-16] Women have been
participating in worship at Corinth without the head-covering normal in Greek
society of the period. Paul's stated goal is to bring them back into conformity
with contemporary practice and propriety. In his desire to convince, he reaches
for arguments from a variety of sources, though he has space to develop them
only sketchily and is perhaps aware that they differ greatly in persuasiveness.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4C7 href="__PZG.HTM#-4C7">3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3] A husband the head of his wife:
the specific problem suggests to Paul the model of the head as a device for
clarifying relations within a hierarchical structure. The model is similar to
that developed later in greater detail and nuance in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P10C.HTM#NTLET.EPH.5.21"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Eph
5:21-33. It is a hybrid model, for it grafts onto a strictly
theological scale of existence (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZ8.HTM#NTLET.1COR.3.21"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 3:21-23)
the hierarchy of sociosexual relations prevalent in the ancient world: men,
dominant, reflect the active function of Christ in relation to his church;
women, submissive, reflect the passive role of the church with respect to its
savior. This gives us the functional scale: God, Christ, man, woman.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4C8 href="__PZG.HTM#-4C8">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [4-6] From man's direct relation to
Christ, Paul infers that his head should not be covered. But woman, related not
directly to Christ on the scale but to her husband, requires a covering as a
sign of that relationship. Shameful . . . to have her hair cut off: certain
less honored classes in society, such as lesbians and prostitutes, are thought
to have worn their hair close-cropped.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4C9 href="__PZG.HTM#-4C9">5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [7-9] The hierarchy of v 3 is now
expressed in other metaphors: the image (eikon) and the reflected glory (doxa).
Paul is alluding basically to the text of <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P3.HTM#PENT.GEN.1.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
1:27, in which mankind as a whole, the male-female couple, is created
in God's image and given the command to multiply and together dominate the
lower creation. But <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P3.HTM#PENT.GEN.1.24"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 1:24 is interpreted
here in the light of the second creation narrative in Genesis 2 in which each
of the sexes is created separately (first the man and then the woman from man
and for him, to be his helpmate, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4.HTM#PENT.GEN.2.20"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 2:20-23),
and under the influence of the story of the fall, as a result of which the
husband rules over the woman (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P5.HTM#PENT.GEN.3.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 3:16). This
interpretation splits the single image of God into two, at different degrees of
closeness.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4CA href="__PZG.HTM#-4CA">6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [10] A sign of authority:
&quot;authority&quot; (exousia) may possibly be due to mistranslation of an
Aramaic word for &quot;veil&quot;; in any case, the connection with
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:9 indicates that the covering is a sign
of woman's subordination. Because of the angels: a surprising additional
reason, which the context does not clarify. Presumably the reference is to
cosmic powers who might inflict harm on women or whose function is to watch
over women or the cult.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4CB href="__PZG.HTM#-4CB">7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [11-12] These parenthetical remarks
relativize the argument from Genesis 2-3. In the Lord: in the Christian economy
the relation between the sexes is characterized by a mutual dependence, which
is not further specified. And even in the natural order conditions have
changed: the mode of origin described in Genesis 2 has been reversed
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:12a). But the ultimately significant
fact is the origin that all things have in common (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor

Cor 11:14-15 contain a final appeal to the sense of propriety that
contemporary Greek society would consider &quot;natural&quot; (cf
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:5-6).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4CD href="__PZG.HTM#-4CD">9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [17-34] Paul turns to another abuse
connected with the liturgy, and a more serious one, for it involves neglect of
basic Christian tradition concerning the meaning of the Lord's Supper. Paul
recalls that tradition for them and reminds them of its implications.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4CE href="__PZG.HTM#-4CE">10</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [19] That . . . those who are
approved among you may become known: Paul situates their divisions within the
context of the eschatological separation of the authentic from the inauthentic
and the final revelation of the difference. The notion of authenticity-testing
recurs in the injunction to self-examination in view of present and future
judgment (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:28-32).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4CF href="__PZG.HTM#-4CF">11</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [23-25] This is the earliest
written account of the institution of the Lord's Supper in the New Testament.
The narrative emphasizes Jesus' action of self-giving (expressed in the words
over the bread and the cup) and his double command to repeat his own action.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4CG href="__PZG.HTM#-4CG">12</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [27] It follows that the only
proper way to celebrate the Eucharist is one that corresponds to Jesus'
intention, which fits with the meaning of his command to reproduce his action
in the proper spirit. If the Corinthians eat and drink unworthily, i.e.,
without having grasped and internalized the meaning of his death for them, they
will have to answer for the body and blood, i.e., will be guilty of a sin
against the Lord himself (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZD.HTM#NTLET.1COR.8.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 8:12).</p>

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZG.HTM#NTLET.1COR.11.29"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor 11:29), which, from the context, must

that Jesus gives himself to all and requires us to repeat his sacrifice in the
