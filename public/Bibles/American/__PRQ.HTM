<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 18</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the word of the LORD came to me: Son of
man, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2J6 href="__PRQ.HTM#$2J6">1</a></sup></font></sup> what is the meaning of this proverb that you
recite in the land of Israel: &quot;Fathers have eaten green grapes, thus their
children's teeth are on edge&quot;? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As I live, says the Lord GOD: I swear that
there shall no longer be anyone among you who will repeat this proverb in
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For all lives are mine; the life of the father
is like the life of the son, both are mine; only the one who sins shall die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If a man is virtuous - if he does what is right
and just, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2J7 href="__PRQ.HTM#$2J7">2</a></sup></font></sup> if he does not eat on the mountains, nor raise
his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; if he does not defile his
neighbor's wife, nor have relations with a woman in her menstrual period; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>if he oppresses no one, gives back the pledge
received for a debt, commits no robbery; if he gives food to the hungry and
clothes the naked; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>if he does not lend at interest nor exact
usury; if he holds off from evildoing, judges fairly between a man and his
opponent; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>if he lives by my statutes and is careful to
observe my ordinances, that man is virtuous - he shall surely live, says the
Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if he begets a son who is a thief, a
murderer, or who does any of these things </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(though the father does none of them), a son
who eats on the mountains, defiles the wife of his neighbor, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery,
does not give back a pledge, raises his eyes to idols, does abominable things, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>lends at interest and exacts usury - this son
certainly shall not live. Because he practiced all these abominations, he shall
surely die; his death shall be his own fault. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the other hand, if a man begets a son who,
seeing all the sins his father commits, yet fears and does not imitate him; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a son who does not eat on the mountains, or
raise his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's
wife; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who does not oppress anyone, or exact a pledge,
or commit robbery; who gives his food to the hungry and clothes the naked; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who holds off from evildoing, accepts no
interest or usury, but keeps my ordinances and lives by my statutes - this one
shall not die for the sins of his father, but shall surely live. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only the father, since he violated rights, and
robbed, and did what was not good among his people, shall in truth die for his
sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You ask: &quot;Why is not the son charged with
the guilt of his father?&quot; Because the son has done what is right and just,
and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only the one who sins shall die. The son shall
not be charged with the guilt of his father, nor shall the father be charged
with the guilt of his son. The virtuous man's virtue shall be his own, as the
wicked man's wickedness shall be his own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if the wicked man turns away from all the
sins he committed, if he keeps all my statutes and does what is right and just,
he shall surely live, he shall not die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>None of the crimes he committed shall be
remembered against him; he shall live because of the virtue he has practiced. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do I indeed derive any pleasure from the death
of the wicked? says the Lord GOD. Do I not rather rejoice when he turns from
his evil way that he may live? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And if the virtuous man turns from the path of
virtue to do evil, the same kind of abominable things that the wicked man does,
can he do this and still live? None of his virtuous deeds shall be remembered,
because he has broken faith and committed sin; because of this, he shall die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You say, &quot;The LORD'S way is not
fair!&quot; Hear now, house of Israel: Is it my way that is unfair, or rather,
are not your ways unfair? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When a virtuous man turns away from virtue to
commit iniquity, and dies, it is because of the iniquity he committed that he
must die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if a wicked man, turning from the
wickedness he has committed, does what is right and just, he shall preserve his
life; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>since he has turned away from all the sins
which he committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And yet the house of Israel says, &quot;The
LORD'S way is not fair!&quot; Is it my way that is not fair, house of Israel,
or rather, is it not that your ways are not fair? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel,
each one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Turn and be converted from
all your crimes, that they may be no cause of guilt for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Cast away from you all the crimes you have
committed, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you
die, O house of Israel? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone
who dies, says the Lord GOD. Return and live! </p>
