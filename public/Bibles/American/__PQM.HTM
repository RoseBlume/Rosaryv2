<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This word came to Jeremiah for all the people
of Judah who were living in Egypt, at Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in Upper
Egypt: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2FC href="__PQM.HTM#$2FC">1</a></sup></font></sup> Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of
Israel: You have seen all the evil I brought on Jerusalem and the other cities
of Judah. Today they are ruins and uninhabited, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because of the evil they did to provoke me,
going after strange gods, serving them and sacrificing to them, gods which
neither they, nor you, nor your fathers knew. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though I kept sending to you all my servants the
prophets, with the plea not to commit this horrible deed which I hate, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they would not listen or accept the warning to
turn away from the evil of sacrificing to strange gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the fury of my anger poured forth in
flame over the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, so that they
became the ruinous waste they are today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of
Israel: Why do you inflict so great an evil upon yourselves? Will you root out
from Judah man and wife, child and nursling, and not leave yourselves even a
remnant? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Will you go on provoking me by the works of
your hands, by sacrificing to strange gods here in the land of Egypt where you
have come to live? Will you be rooted out and become a curse and a disgrace
among all the nations of the earth? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Have you forgotten the evil deeds which your
fathers, and the kings of Judah and their wives, and you yourselves and your
wives have done in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To this day they have not been crushed; they do
not fear or follow the law and the statutes which I set before you and your
fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hence, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of
Israel: I have determined evil against you; and I will uproot all Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will take away the remnant of Judah who
insisted on coming to dwell in Egypt, so that they shall be wholly destroyed.
In the land of Egypt they shall fall by the sword or be consumed by hunger.
High and low, they shall die by the sword, or by hunger, and become an example
of malediction, a horror, a curse and a reproach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus will I punish those who live in Egypt,
just as I punished Jerusalem with sword, hunger, and pestilence. None of the
remnant of Judah that have come to settle in the land of Egypt shall escape or
survive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>None shall return to the land of Judah, though
they yearn to return and live there. Only scattered refugees shall return. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From all the men who knew that their wives were
burning incense to strange gods, from all the women who were present in the
immense crowd, and from all the people who lived in Lower and Upper Egypt,
Jeremiah received this answer: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We will not listen to what you say in the
name of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rather will we continue doing what we had
proposed; we will burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to
her, as we and our fathers, our kings and princes have done in the cities of
Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had enough food to eat and we were
well off; we suffered no misfortune. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But since we stopped burning incense to the
queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we are in need of everything
and are being destroyed by the sword and by hunger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when we burned incense to the queen of
heaven and poured out libations to her, was it without our husbands' consent
that we baked for her cakes in her image and poured out libations to her?&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To all the people, men and women, who gave him
this answer, Jeremiah said: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was it not this that the LORD remembered and
brought to mind, that you burned incense in the cities of Judah and the streets
of Jerusalem: you, your fathers, your kings and princes, and the people
generally? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD could no longer bear your evil deeds,
the horrible things which you were doing; and so your land became a waste, a
desert, a thing accursed and without inhabitants, as it is today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because you burned incense and sinned against
the LORD, not obeying the voice of the LORD, not living by his law, his
statutes, and his decrees, this evil has befallen you at the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeremiah said further to all the people,
including the women: Hear the word of the LORD, all you Judeans in the land of
Egypt: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:
You and your wives have stated your intentions, and kept them in fact: &quot;We
will continue to fulfill the vows we have made to burn incense to the queen of
heaven and to pour out libations to her.&quot; Very well! keep your vows, carry
out your resolutions! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But listen then to the word of the LORD, all
you people of Judah who live in Egypt; I swear by my own great name, says the
LORD, in the whole land of Egypt no man of Judah shall henceforth pronounce my
name, saying, &quot;As the Lord GOD lives.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am watching over them to do evil, not good.
All the men of Judah in Egypt shall perish by the sword or famine until they
are utterly destroyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those who escape the sword to return from the
land of Egypt to the land of Judah shall be few in number. The whole remnant of
Judah who came to settle in Egypt shall know whose word stands, mine or theirs.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That you may know how surely my threats of
punishment for you shall be fulfilled, this shall be a sign to you, says the
LORD, that I will punish you in this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2FD href="__PQM.HTM#$2FD">2</a></sup></font></sup> Thus says the LORD: See! I will hand over
Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, to his enemies, to those who seek his life, just
as I handed over Zedekiah, king of Judah, to his enemy and mortal foe,
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. </p>
