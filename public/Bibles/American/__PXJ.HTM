<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3V8 href="__PXJ.HTM#$3V8">1</a></sup></font></sup> Now a man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the
village of Mary and her sister Martha. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Mary was the one who had anointed the Lord with
perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair; it was her brother Lazarus who
was ill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the sisters sent word to him, saying,
&quot;Master, the one you love is ill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jesus heard this he said, &quot;This
illness is not to end in death, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3V9 href="__PXJ.HTM#$3V9">2</a></sup></font></sup> but is for the glory of
God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and
Lazarus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when he heard that he was ill, he remained for
two days in the place where he was. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then after this he said to his disciples,
&quot;Let us go back to Judea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The disciples said to him, &quot;Rabbi, the
Jews were just trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus answered, &quot;Are there not twelve
hours in a day? If one walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he
sees the light of this world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if one walks at night, he stumbles, because
the light is not in him.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VA href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VA">3</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said this, and then told them, &quot;Our
friend Lazarus is asleep, but I am going to awaken him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the disciples said to him, &quot;Master, if
he is asleep, he will be saved.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jesus was talking about his death, while
they thought that he meant ordinary sleep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So then Jesus said to them clearly,
&quot;Lazarus has died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And I am glad for you that I was not there,
that you may believe. Let us go to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Thomas, called Didymus, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VB href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VB">4</a></sup></font></sup>
said to his fellow disciples, &quot;Let us also go to die with him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had
already been in the tomb for four days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two
miles <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VC href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VC">5</a></sup></font></sup> away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And many of the Jews had come to Martha and
Mary to comfort them about their brother. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went
to meet him; but Mary sat at home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Martha said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, if you had
been here, my brother would not have died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(But) even now I know that whatever you ask of
God, God will give you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus said to her, &quot;Your brother will
rise.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Martha said to him, &quot;I know he will rise,
in the resurrection on the last day.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus told her, &quot;I am the resurrection and
the life; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and everyone who lives and believes in me will
never die. Do you believe this?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VD href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VD">6</a></sup></font></sup> She said to him, &quot;Yes, Lord. I have come
to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who is coming into
the world.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When she had said this, she went and called her
sister Mary secretly, saying, &quot;The teacher is here and is asking for
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as she heard this, she rose quickly and
went to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For Jesus had not yet come into the village,
but was still where Martha had met him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when the Jews who were with her in the house
comforting her saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, presuming
that she was going to the tomb to weep there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him,
she fell at his feet and said to him, &quot;Lord, if you had been here, my
brother would not have died.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had
come with her weeping, he became perturbed <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VE href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VE">7</a></sup></font></sup> and deeply
troubled, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said, &quot;Where have you laid him?&quot;
They said to him, &quot;Sir, come and see.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Jesus wept. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the Jews said, &quot;See how he loved
him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But some of them said, &quot;Could not the one
who opened the eyes of the blind man have done something so that this man would
not have died?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb. It
was a cave, and a stone lay across it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus said, &quot;Take away the stone.&quot;
Martha, the dead man's sister, said to him, &quot;Lord, by now there will be a
stench; he has been dead for four days.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus said to her, &quot;Did I not tell you
that if you believe you will see the glory of God?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised
his eyes and said, &quot;Father, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VF href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VF">8</a></sup></font></sup> I thank you for hearing
me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I know that you always hear me; but because of
the crowd here I have said this, that they may believe that you sent me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when he had said this, he cried out in a
loud voice, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VG href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VG">9</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Lazarus, come out!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The dead man came out, tied hand and foot with
burial bands, and his face was wrapped in a cloth. So Jesus said to them,
&quot;Untie him and let him go.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary and
seen what he had done began to believe in him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told
them what Jesus had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the chief priests and the Pharisees convened
the Sanhedrin and said, &quot;What are we going to do? This man is performing
many signs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If we leave him alone, all will believe in him,
and the Romans will come <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VH href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VH">10</a></sup></font></sup> and take away both our land and
our nation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest
that year, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VI href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VI">11</a></sup></font></sup> said to them, &quot;You know nothing, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>nor do you consider that it is better for you
that one man should die instead of the people, so that the whole nation may not
perish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did not say this on his own, but since he
was high priest for that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for
the nation, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and not only for the nation, but also to gather
into one the dispersed children of God. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VJ href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VJ">12</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So from that day on they planned to kill him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jesus no longer walked about in public among
the Jews, but he left for the region near the desert, to a town called Ephraim,
<sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VK href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VK">13</a></sup></font></sup> and there he remained with his disciples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many
went up from the country to Jerusalem before Passover to purify <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3VL href="__PXJ.HTM#$3VL">14</a></sup></font></sup>
themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They looked for Jesus and said to one another
as they were in the temple area, &quot;What do you think? That he will not come
to the feast?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the chief priests and the Pharisees had
given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should inform them, so that
they might arrest him. </p>

longest continuous narrative in John outside of the passion account, is the
climax of the signs. It leads directly to the decision of the Sanhedrin to kill
Jesus. The theme of life predominates. Lazarus is a token of the real life that
Jesus dead and raised will give to all who believe in him. Johannine irony is
found in the fact that Jesus' gift of life leads to his own death. The story is
not found in the synoptics, but cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW7.HTM#GOSP.MAR.5.21"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 5:21 and
parallels; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:11-17. There are also parallels
between this story and Luke's parable of the rich man and poor Lazarus
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWZ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.16.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 16:19-31). In both a man named Lazarus
dies; in Luke, there is a request that he return to convince his contemporaries
of the need for faith and repentance, while in John, Lazarus does return and
some believe but others do not. </p>
