<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 18</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(By the time David finished speaking with Saul,
Jonathan had become as fond of David as if his life depended on him; he loved
him as he loved himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul laid claim to David that day and did not
allow him to return to his father's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Jonathan entered into a bond with David,
because he loved him as himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan divested himself of the mantle he was
wearing and gave it to David, along with his military dress, and his sword, his
bow and his belt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then carried out successfully every
mission on which Saul sent him. So Saul put him in charge of his soldiers, and
this was agreeable to the whole army, even to Saul's own officers.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the approach of Saul and David (on David's
return after slaying the Philistine), women came out from each of the cities of
Israel to meet King Saul, singing and dancing, with tambourines, joyful songs,
and sistrums. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The women played and sang: &quot;Saul has slain
his thousands, and David his ten thousands.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul was very angry and resentful of the song,
for he thought: &quot;They give David ten thousands, but only thousands to me.
All that remains for him is the kingship.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(And from that day on, Saul was jealous of
David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The next day an evil spirit from God came over
Saul, and he raged in his house. David was in attendance, playing the harp as
at other times, while Saul was holding his spear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul poised the spear, thinking to nail David
to the wall, but twice David escaped him.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then began to fear David, (because the
LORD was with him, but had departed from Saul himself.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly, Saul removed him from his presence
by appointing him a field officer. So David led the people on their military
expeditions, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and prospered in all his enterprises, for the
LORD was with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seeing how successful he was, Saul conceived a
fear of David: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>on the other hand, all Israel and Judah loved
him, since he led them on their expeditions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Saul said to David, &quot;There is my older
daughter, Merob, whom I will give you in marriage if you become my champion and
fight the battles of the LORD.&quot; Saul had in mind, &quot;I shall not touch
him; let the Philistines strike him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David answered Saul: &quot;Who am I? And
who are my kin or my father's clan in Israel that I should become the king's
son-in-law?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, when it was time for Saul's daughter
Merob to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel the Meholathite
instead.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Saul's daughter Michal loved David, and it
was reported to Saul, who was pleased at this, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for he thought, &quot;I will offer her to him
to become a snare for him, so that the Philistines may strike him.&quot; (Thus
for the second time Saul said to David, &quot;You shall become my son-in-law
today.&quot;) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then ordered his servants to speak to
David privately and to say: &quot;The king is fond of you, and all his officers
love you. You should become the king's son-in-law.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when Saul's servants mentioned this to
David, he said: &quot;Do you think it easy to become the king's son-in-law? I
am poor and insignificant.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his servants reported to him the nature of
David's answer, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul commanded them to say this to David:
&quot;The king desires no other price for the bride than the foreskins of one
hundred Philistines, that he may thus take vengeance on his enemies.&quot; Saul
intended in this way to bring about David's death through the Philistines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the servants reported this offer to David,
he was pleased with the prospect of becoming the king's son-in-law. (Before the
year was up,) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David made preparations and sallied forth with
his men and slew two hundred Philistines. He brought back their foreskins and
counted them out before the king, that he might thus become the king's
son-in-law. So Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul thus came to recognize that the LORD was
with David; besides, his own daughter Michal loved David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore Saul feared David all the more (and
was his enemy ever after). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The Philistine chiefs continued to make
forays, but each time they took the field, David was more successful against
them than any other of Saul's officers, and as a result acquired great fame.) </p>
