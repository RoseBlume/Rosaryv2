<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With violet, purple and scarlet yarn were woven
the service cloths for use in the sanctuary, as well as the sacred vestments
for Aaron, as the LORD had commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The ephod was woven of gold thread and of
violet, purple and scarlet yarn and of fine linen twined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gold was first hammered into gold leaf and then
cut up into threads, which were woven with the violet, purple and scarlet yarn
into an embroidered pattern on the fine linen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shoulder straps were made for it and joined to
its two upper ends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The embroidered belt on the ephod extended out
from it, and like it, was made of gold thread, of violet, purple and scarlet
yarn, and of fine linen twined, as the LORD had commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The onyx stones were prepared and mounted in
gold filigree work; they were engraved like seal engravings with the names of
the sons of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These stones were set on the shoulder straps of
the ephod as memorial stones of the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had
commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The breastpiece was embroidered like the ephod,
with gold thread and violet, purple and scarlet yarn on cloth of fine linen
twined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was square and folded double, a span high
and a span wide in its folded form. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Four rows of precious stones were mounted on
it: in the first row a carnelian, a topaz and an emerald; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in the second row, a garnet, a sapphire and a
beryl; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an
amethyst; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a
jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These stones were twelve, to match the names of
the sons of Israel, and each stone was engraved like a seal with the name of
one of the twelve tribes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, were
made for the breastpiece, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>together with two gold filigree rosettes and
two gold rings. The two rings were fastened to the two upper ends of the
breastpiece. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The two gold chains were then fastened to the
two rings at the ends of the breastpiece. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The other two ends of the two chains were
fastened in front to the two filigree rosettes, which were attached to the
shoulder straps of the ephod. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Two other gold rings were made and put on the
two lower ends of the breastpiece, on the edge facing the ephod. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Two more gold rings were made and fastened to
the bottom of the two shoulder straps next to where they joined the ephod in
front, just above its embroidered belt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Violet ribbons bound the rings of the
breastpiece to the rings of the ephod, so that the breastpiece stayed right
above the embroidered belt of the ephod and did not swing loose from it. All
this was just as the LORD had commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The robe of the ephod was woven entirely of
violet yarn, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with an opening in its center like the opening
of a shirt, with selvage around the opening to keep it from being torn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the hem of the robe pomegranates were made
of violet, purple and scarlet yarn and of fine linen twined; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>bells of pure gold were also made and put
between the pomegranates all around the hem of the robe: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>first a bell, then a pomegranate, and thus
alternating all around the hem of the robe which was to be worn in performing
the ministry - all this, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For Aaron and his sons there were also woven
tunics of fine linen; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the miter of fine linen; the ornate turbans of
fine linen; drawers of linen (of fine linen twined); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and sashes of variegated work made of fine
linen twined and of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, as the LORD had commanded
Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The plate of the sacred diadem was made of pure
gold and inscribed, as on a seal engraving: &quot;Sacred to the LORD.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was tied over the miter with a violet ribbon,
as the LORD had commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the entire work of the Dwelling of the
meeting tent was completed. The Israelites did the work just as the LORD had
commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They then brought to Moses the Dwelling, the
tent with all its appurtenances, the clasps, the boards, the bars, the columns,
the pedestals, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the
covering of tahash skins, the curtain veil; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the ark of the commandments with its poles, the
propitiatory, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the table with all its appurtenances and the
showbread, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the pure gold lampstand with its lamps set up
on it and with all its appurtenances, the oil for the light, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the golden altar, the anointing oil, the
fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the tent, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the altar of bronze with its bronze grating,
its poles and all its appurtenances, the laver with its base, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the hangings of the court with their columns
and pedestals, the curtain for the entrance of the court with its ropes and
tent pegs, all the equipment for the service of the Dwelling of the meeting
tent; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the service cloths for use in the sanctuary,
the sacred vestments for Aaron the priest, and the vestments to be worn by his
sons in their ministry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites had carried out all the work
just as the LORD had commanded Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when Moses saw that all the work was done
just as the LORD had commanded, he blessed them. </p>
