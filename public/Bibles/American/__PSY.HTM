</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2NN href="__PSY.HTM#$2NN">1</a></sup></font></sup> In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who married a very beautiful and God-fearing
woman, Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>her pious parents had trained their daughter
according to the law of Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joakim was very rich; he had a garden near his
house, and the Jews had recourse to him often because he was the most respected
of them all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That year, two elders of the people were
appointed judges, of whom the Lord said, &quot;Wickedness has come out of
Babylon: from the elders who were to govern the people as judges.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These men, to whom all brought their cases,
frequented the house of Joakim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the people left at noon, Susanna used to
enter her husband's garden for a walk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the old men saw her enter every day for
her walk, they began to lust for her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They suppressed their consciences; they would
not allow their eyes to look to heaven, and did not keep in mind just
judgments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though both were enamored of her, they did not
tell each other their trouble, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for they were ashamed to reveal their lustful
desire to have her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Day by day they watched eagerly for her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One day they said to each other, &quot;Let us
be off for home, it is time for lunch.&quot; So they went out and parted; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but both turned back, and when they met again,
they asked each other the reason. They admitted their lust, and then they
agreed to look for an occasion when they could meet her alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One day, while they were waiting for the right
moment, she entered the garden as usual, with two maids only. She decided to
bathe, for the weather was warm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nobody else was there except the two elders,
who had hidden themselves and were watching her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Bring me oil and soap,&quot; she said to
the maids, &quot;and shut the garden doors while I bathe.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They did as she said; they shut the garden
doors and left by the side gate to fetch what she had ordered, unaware that the
elders were hidden inside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as the maids had left, the two old men
got up and hurried to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Look,&quot; they said, &quot;the garden
doors are shut, and no one can see us; give in to our desire, and lie with us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you refuse, we will testify against you that
you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I am completely trapped,&quot; Susanna
groaned. &quot;If I yield, it will be my death; if I refuse, I cannot escape
your power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet it is better for me to fall into your power
without guilt than to sin before the Lord.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also
shouted at her, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as one of them ran to open the garden doors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the people in the house heard the cries
from the garden, they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to
her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the accusations by the old men, the servants
felt very much ashamed, for never had any such thing been said about Susanna. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the people came to her husband Joakim the
next day, the two wicked elders also came, fully determined to put Susanna to
death. Before all the people they ordered: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Send for Susanna, the daughter of
Hilkiah, the wife of Joakim.&quot; When she was sent for, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>she came with her parents, children and all her
relatives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Susanna, very delicate and beautiful, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>was veiled; but those wicked men ordered her to
uncover her face so as to sate themselves with her beauty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All her relatives and the onlookers were
weeping. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the midst of the people the two elders rose
up and laid their hands on her head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Through her tears she looked up to heaven, for
she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The elders made this accusation: &quot;As we
were walking in the garden alone, this woman entered with two girls and shut
the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay
with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this
crime, we ran toward them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We saw them lying together, but the man we
could not hold, because he was stronger than we; he opened the doors and ran
off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then we seized this one and asked who the young
man was, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but she refused to tell us. We testify to
this.&quot; The assembly believed them, since they were elders and judges of
the people, and they condemned her to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Susanna cried aloud: &quot;O eternal God, you
know what is hidden and are aware of all things before they come to be: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you know that they have testified falsely
against me. Here I am about to die, though I have done none of the things with
which these wicked men have charged me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Lord heard her prayer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As she was being led to execution, God stirred
up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he cried aloud: &quot;I will have no part
in the death of this woman.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people turned and asked him, &quot;What
is this you are saying?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He stood in their midst and continued,
&quot;Are you such fools, O Israelites! To condemn a woman of Israel without
examination and without clear evidence? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Return to court, for they have testified
falsely against her.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the people returned in haste. To
Daniel the elders said, &quot;Come, sit with us and inform us, since God has
given you the prestige of old age.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he replied, &quot;Separate these two far
from one another that I may examine them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After they were separated one from the other,
he called one of them and said: &quot;How you have grown evil with age! Now
have your past sins come to term: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>passing unjust sentences, condemning the
innocent, and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says, &quot;The innocent
and the just you shall not put to death.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, then, if you were a witness, tell me under
what tree you saw them together.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2NO href="__PSY.HTM#$2NO">2</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Under a mastic tree,&quot; he answered.
&quot;Your fine lie has cost you your head,&quot; said Daniel; &quot;for the
angel of God shall receive the sentence from him and split you in two.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Putting him to one side, he ordered the other
one to be brought. &quot;Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,&quot; Daniel said
to him, &quot;beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2NP href="__PSY.HTM#$2NP">3</a></sup></font></sup> This is how you acted with the daughters of
Israel, and in their fear they yielded to you; but a daughter of Judah did not
tolerate your wickedness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, then, tell me under what tree you
surprised them together.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>59
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Under an oak,&quot; he said. &quot;Your
fine lie has cost you also your head,&quot; said Daniel; &quot;for the angel of
God waits with a sword to cut you in two so as to make an end of you
both.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The whole assembly cried aloud, blessing God
who saves those that hope in him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>61
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They rose up against the two elders, for by
their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury. According to the law of
Moses, they inflicted on them the penalty they had plotted to impose on their
neighbor: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>62
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they put them to death. Thus was innocent blood
spared that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>63
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hilkiah and his wife praised God for their
daughter Susanna, as did Joakim her husband and all her relatives, because she
was found innocent of any shameful deed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>64
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And from that day onward Daniel was greatly
esteemed by the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

in these two chapters may have originally been about some other Daniel or
Daniels Than the hero of the main part of the book. They exist now only in
Greek, but probably were first composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. They are excluded
from the Jewish canon of Scripture, but the Church has always included them
among the inspired writings. </p>

between the mastic tree, which is small, and the majestic oak emphasizes the
contradiction between the statements of the two elders. In the Greek text there
is a play on words between the names of these two trees and the mortal
punishment decreed by Daniel for the elders.</p>

contrasting the northern and the southern kingdoms, Israel and Judah, in favor
of the latter.</p>
