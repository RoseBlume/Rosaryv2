<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After a lapse of two years, Pharaoh had a
dream. He saw himself standing by the Nile, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when up out of the Nile came seven cows,
handsome and fat; they grazed in the reed grass. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Behind them seven other cows, ugly and gaunt,
came up out of the Nile; and standing on the bank of the Nile beside the
others, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the ugly, gaunt cows ate up the seven handsome,
fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He fell asleep again and had another dream. He
saw seven ears of grain, fat and healthy, growing on a single stalk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain, thin
and blasted by the east wind; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven
fat, healthy ears. Then Pharaoh woke up, to find it was only a dream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Next morning his spirit was agitated. So he
summoned all the magicians and sages of Egypt and recounted his dreams to them;
but no one could interpret his dreams for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the chief cupbearer spoke up and said to
Pharaoh: &quot;On this occasion I am reminded of my negligence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once, when Pharaoh was angry, he put me and the
chief baker in custody in the house of the chief steward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Later, we both had dreams on the same night,
and each of our dreams had its own meaning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There with us was a Hebrew youth, a slave of
the chief steward; and when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us
and explained for each of us the meaning of his dream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And it turned out just as he had told us: I was
restored to my post, but the other man was impaled.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh therefore had Joseph summoned, and they
hurriedly brought him from the dungeon. After he shaved and changed his
clothes, he came into Pharaoh's presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh then said to him: &quot;I had certain
dreams that no one can interpret. But I hear it said of you that the moment you
are told a dream you can interpret it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;It is not I,&quot; Joseph replied to
Pharaoh, &quot;but God who will give Pharaoh the right answer.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: &quot;In my dream,
I was standing on the bank of the Nile, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when up from the Nile came seven cows, fat and
well-formed; they grazed in the reed grass. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Behind them came seven other cows, scrawny,
most ill-formed and gaunt. Never have I seen such ugly specimens as these in
all the land of Egypt! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The gaunt, ugly cows ate up the first seven fat
cows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they had consumed them, no one could tell
that they had done so, because they looked as ugly as before. Then I woke up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In another dream I saw seven ears of grain, fat
and healthy, growing on a single stalk. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Behind them sprouted seven ears of grain,
shriveled and thin and blasted by the east wind; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven
healthy ears. I have spoken to the magicians, but none of them can give me an
explanation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph said to Pharaoh: &quot;Both of Pharaoh's
dreams have the same meaning. God has thus foretold to Pharaoh what he is about
to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The seven healthy cows are seven years, and the
seven healthy ears are seven years - the same in each dream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So also, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up
after them are seven years, as are the seven thin, wind-blasted ears; they are
seven years of famine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It is just as I told Pharaoh: God has revealed
to Pharaoh what he is about to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seven years of great abundance are now coming
throughout the land of Egypt; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but these will be followed by seven years of
famine, when all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. When the
famine has ravaged the land, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>no trace of the abundance will be found in the
land because of the famine that follows it - so utterly severe will that famine
be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That Pharaoh had the same dream twice means
that the matter has been reaffirmed by God and that God will soon bring it
about. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Therefore, let Pharaoh seek out a wise
and discerning man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh should also take action to appoint overseers,
so as to regiment the land during the seven years of abundance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They should husband all the food of the coming
good years, collecting the grain under Pharaoh's authority, to be stored in the
towns for food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This food will serve as a reserve for the
country against the seven years of famine that are to follow in the land of
Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This advice pleased Pharaoh and all his officials.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Could we find another like him,&quot;
Pharaoh asked his officials, &quot;a man so endowed with the spirit of
God?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Pharaoh said to Joseph: &quot;Since God has
made all this known to you, no one can be as wise and discerning as you are. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my
people shall dart at your command. Only in respect to the throne shall I
outrank you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Herewith,&quot; Pharaoh told Joseph, &quot;I
place you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5Z href="__P17.HTM#$5Z">1</a></sup></font></sup> With that, Pharaoh took off his signet ring
and put it on Joseph's finger. He had him dressed in robes of fine linen and
put a gold chain about his neck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-60 href="__P17.HTM#$60">2</a></sup></font></sup> He then had him ride in the chariot of his
vizier, and they shouted &quot;Abrek!&quot; before him. Thus was Joseph
installed over the whole land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I, Pharaoh, proclaim,&quot; he told
Joseph, &quot;that without your approval no one shall move hand or foot in all
the land of Egypt.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-61 href="__P17.HTM#$61">3</a></sup></font></sup> Pharaoh also bestowed the name of
Zaphnath-paneah on Joseph, and he gave him in marriage Asenath, the daughter of
Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the
service of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. After Joseph left Pharaoh's presence, he
traveled throughout the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During the seven years of plenty, when the land
produced abundant crops, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he husbanded all the food of these years of
plenty that the land of Egypt was enjoying and stored it in the towns, placing
in each town the crops of the fields around it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph garnered grain in quantities like the sands
of the sea, so vast that at last he stopped measuring it, for it was beyond
measure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Before the famine years set in, Joseph became
the father of two sons, borne to him by Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest
of Heliopolis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-62 href="__P17.HTM#$62">4</a></sup></font></sup> He named his first-born Manasseh, meaning,
&quot;God has made me forget entirely the sufferings I endured at the hands of
my family&quot;; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-63 href="__P17.HTM#$63">5</a></sup></font></sup> and the second he named Ephraim, meaning,
&quot;God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the seven years of abundance enjoyed by
the land of Egypt came to an end, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the seven years of famine set in, just as
Joseph had predicted. Although there was famine in all the other countries,
food was available throughout the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When hunger came to be felt throughout the land
of Egypt and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, Pharaoh directed all the
Egyptians to go to Joseph and do whatever he told them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the famine had spread throughout the land,
Joseph opened all the cities that had grain and rationed it to the Egyptians,
since the famine had gripped the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In fact, all the world came to Joseph to obtain
rations of grain, for famine had gripped the whole world. </p>
