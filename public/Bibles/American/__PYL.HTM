<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45M href="__PYL.HTM#$45M">1</a></sup></font></sup> When it was decided that we should sail to
Italy, they handed Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion named
Julius of the Cohort Augusta. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45N href="__PYL.HTM#$45N">2</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We went on board a ship from Adramyttium bound
for ports in the province of Asia and set sail. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from
Thessalonica, was with us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the following day we put in at Sidon where
Julius was kind enough to allow Paul to visit his friends who took care of him.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From there we put out to sea and sailed around
the sheltered side of Cyprus because of the headwinds, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and crossing the open sea off the coast of
Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra in Lycia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship
that was sailing to Italy and put us on board. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For many days we made little headway, arriving
at Cnidus only with difficulty, and because the wind would not permit us to
continue our course we sailed for the sheltered side of Crete off Salmone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We sailed past it with difficulty and reached a
place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Much time had now passed and sailing had become
hazardous because the time of the fast <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45O href="__PYL.HTM#$45O">3</a></sup></font></sup> had already gone
by, so Paul warned them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Men, I can see that this voyage will
result in severe damage and heavy loss not only to the cargo and the ship, but
also to our lives.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The centurion, however, paid more attention to
the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since the harbor was unfavorably situated for
spending the winter, the majority planned to put out to sea from there in the
hope of reaching Phoenix, a port in Crete facing west-northwest, there to spend
the winter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A south wind blew gently, and thinking they had
attained their objective, they weighed anchor and sailed along close to the
coast of Crete. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Before long an offshore wind of hurricane force
called a &quot;Northeaster&quot; struck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since the ship was caught up in it and could
not head into the wind we gave way and let ourselves be driven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We passed along the sheltered side of an island
named Cauda and managed only with difficulty to get the dinghy under control. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They hoisted it aboard, then used cables to
undergird the ship. Because of their fear that they would run aground on the
shoal of Syrtis, they lowered the drift anchor and were carried along in this
way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We were being pounded by the storm so violently
that the next day they jettisoned some cargo, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and on the third day with their own hands they
threw even the ship's tackle overboard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Neither the sun nor the stars were visible for
many days, and no small storm raged. Finally, all hope of our surviving was
taken away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When many would no longer eat, Paul stood among
them and said, &quot;Men, you should have taken my advice and not have set sail
from Crete and you would have avoided this disastrous loss. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I urge you now to keep up your courage; not one
of you will be lost, only the ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For last night an angel of the God to whom (I)
belong and whom I serve stood by me </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You are
destined to stand before Caesar; and behold, for your sake, God has granted
safety to all who are sailing with you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, keep up your courage, men; I trust
in God that it will turn out as I have been told. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We are destined to run aground on some
island.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the fourteenth night, as we were still being
driven about on the Adriatic Sea, toward midnight the sailors began to suspect
that they were nearing land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took soundings and found twenty fathoms; a
little farther on, they again took soundings and found fifteen fathoms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fearing that we would run aground on a rocky
coast, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sailors then tried to abandon ship; they
lowered the dinghy to the sea on the pretext of going to lay out anchors from
the bow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Paul said to the centurion and the
soldiers, &quot;Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the soldiers cut the ropes of the dinghy and
set it adrift. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Until the day began to dawn, Paul kept urging
all to take some food. He said, &quot;Today is the fourteenth day that you have
been waiting, going hungry and eating nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I urge you, therefore, to take some food; it
will help you survive. Not a hair of the head of anyone of you will be lost.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he said this, he took bread, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45P href="__PYL.HTM#$45P">4</a></sup></font></sup>
gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were all encouraged, and took some food
themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In all, there were two hundred seventy-six of
us on the ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After they had eaten enough, they lightened the
ship by throwing the wheat into the sea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When day came they did not recognize the land,
but made out a bay with a beach. They planned to run the ship ashore on it, if
they could. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they cast off the anchors and abandoned them
to the sea, and at the same time they unfastened the lines of the rudders, and
hoisting the foresail into the wind, they made for the beach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship
aground. The bow was wedged in and could not be moved, but the stern began to
break up under the pounding (of the waves). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners so
that none might swim away and escape, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but the centurion wanted to save Paul and so
kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump
overboard first and get to the shore, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and then the rest, some on planks, others on
debris from the ship. In this way, all reached shore safely. </p>

Luke has written a stirring account of adventure on the high seas, incidental
to his main purpose of showing how well Paul got along with his captors and how
his prophetic influence saved the lives of all on board. The recital also
establishes the existence of Christian communities in Puteoli and Rome. This
account of the voyage and shipwreck also constitutes the final
&quot;we-section&quot; in Acts (see the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYA.HTM#GOSP.ACT.16.10"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts

a Cohort Augusta in Syria during the first century A.D. is attested in inscriptions.
Whatever the historical background to this information given by Luke may be,
the name Augusta serves to increase the prominence and prestige of the prisoner
Paul whose custodians bear so important a Roman name. </p>
