made a straight run for Cos, and on the next day for Rhodes, and from there to
Patara. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went
on board and put out to sea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We caught sight of Cyprus but passed by it on
our left and sailed on toward Syria and put in at Tyre where the ship was to
unload cargo. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There we sought out the disciples and stayed
for a week. They kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to embark for
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the end of our stay we left and resumed our
journey. All of them, women and children included, escorted us out of the city,
and after kneeling on the beach to pray, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>we bade farewell to one another. Then we
boarded the ship, and they returned home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We continued the voyage and came from Tyre to
Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed a day with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the next day we resumed the trip and came to
Caesarea, where we went to the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of
the Seven, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44E href="__PYF.HTM#$44E">2</a></sup></font></sup> and stayed with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had four virgin daughters gifted with
prophecy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We had been there several days when a prophet
named Agabus <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44F href="__PYF.HTM#$44F">3</a></sup></font></sup> came down from Judea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He came up to us, took Paul's belt, bound his
own feet and hands with it, and said, &quot;Thus says the holy Spirit: This is
the way the Jews will bind the owner of this belt in Jerusalem, and they will
hand him over to the Gentiles.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44G href="__PYF.HTM#$44G">4</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When we heard this, we and the local residents
begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Paul replied, &quot;What are you doing,
weeping and breaking my heart? I am prepared not only to be bound but even to
die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since he would not be dissuaded we let the
matter rest, saying, &quot;The Lord's will be done.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44H href="__PYF.HTM#$44H">5</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After these days we made preparations for our
journey, then went up to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some of the disciples from Caesarea came along
to lead us to the house of Mnason, a Cypriot, a disciple of long standing, with
whom we were to stay. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44I href="__PYF.HTM#$44I">6</a></sup></font></sup> When we reached Jerusalem the brothers
welcomed us warmly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day, Paul accompanied us on a visit to
James, and all the presbyters were present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He greeted them, then proceeded to tell them in
detail what God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They praised God when they heard it but said to
him, &quot;Brother, you see how many thousands of believers there are from
among the Jews, and they are all zealous observers of the law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They have been informed that you are teaching
all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to abandon Moses and that you are
telling them not to circumcise their children or to observe their customary
practices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What is to be done? They will surely hear that
you have arrived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44J href="__PYF.HTM#$44J">7</a></sup></font></sup> So do what we tell you. We have four men who
have taken a vow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take these men and purify yourself with them,
and pay their expenses <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44K href="__PYF.HTM#$44K">8</a></sup></font></sup> that they may have their heads
shaved. In this way everyone will know that there is nothing to the reports
they have been given about you but that you yourself live in observance of the
law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for the Gentiles who have come to believe,
we sent them our decision that they abstain from meat sacrificed to idols, from
blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from unlawful marriage.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44L href="__PYF.HTM#$44L">9</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Paul took the men, and on the next day after
purifying himself together with them entered the temple to give notice of the
day when the purification would be completed and the offering made for each of
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the seven days were nearly completed, the
Jews from the province of Asia noticed him in the temple, stirred up the whole
crowd, and laid hands on him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>shouting, &quot;Fellow Israelites, help us.
This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the
law and this place, and what is more, he has even brought Greeks into the
temple and defiled this sacred place.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44M href="__PYF.HTM#$44M">10</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For they had previously seen Trophimus the
Ephesian in the city with him and supposed that Paul had brought him into the
temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The whole city was in turmoil with people
rushing together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and
immediately the gates were closed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While they were trying to kill him, a report
reached the cohort commander <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44N href="__PYF.HTM#$44N">11</a></sup></font></sup> that all Jerusalem was
rioting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He immediately took soldiers and centurions and
charged down on them. When they saw the commander and the soldiers they stopped
beating Paul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cohort commander came forward, arrested
him, and ordered him to be secured with two chains; he tried to find out who he
might be and what he had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some in the mob shouted one thing, others
something else; so, since he was unable to ascertain the truth because of the
uproar, he ordered Paul to be brought into the compound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he reached the steps, he was carried by
the soldiers because of the violence of the mob, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44O href="__PYF.HTM#$44O">12</a></sup></font></sup> for a crowd of people followed and shouted,
&quot;Away with him!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Just as Paul was about to be taken into the compound,
he said to the cohort commander, &quot;May I say something to you?&quot; He
replied, &quot;Do you speak Greek? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So then you are not the Egyptian <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44P href="__PYF.HTM#$44P">13</a></sup></font></sup>
who started a revolt some time ago and led the four thousand assassins into the
desert?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul answered, &quot;I am a Jew, of Tarsus in
Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; I request you to permit me to speak to the
people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had given his permission, Paul stood on
the steps and motioned with his hand to the people; and when all was quiet he
addressed them in Hebrew. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44Q href="__PYF.HTM#$44Q">14</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

Christians of Jerusalem inform Paul that the Jews there believe he has
encouraged the Jews of the diaspora to abandon the Mosaic law. According to
Acts, Paul had no objection to the retention of the law by the Jewish
Christians of Jerusalem and left the Jews of the diaspora who accepted
Christianity free to follow the same practice.</p>

termination of the Nazirite vow (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P3K.HTM#PENT.NUM.6.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Numbers
6:1-24) in order to impress favorably the Jewish Christians in
Jerusalem with his high regard for the Mosaic law. Since Paul himself had once
made this vow (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYC.HTM#GOSP.ACT.18.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 18:18), his respect for the

Luke to remind his readers that the Gentile Christians themselves were asked to
respect certain Jewish practices deriving from the law.</p>
