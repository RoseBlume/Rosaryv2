<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Saul was consenting to his execution.On
that day, there broke out a severe persecution <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-411 href="__PY2.HTM#$411">1</a></sup></font></sup> of the
church in Jerusalem, and all were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea
and Samaria, except the apostles. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-412 href="__PY2.HTM#$412">2</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Devout men buried Stephen and made a loud
lament over him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul, meanwhile, was trying to destroy the
church; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-413 href="__PY2.HTM#$413">3</a></sup></font></sup> entering house after house and dragging out men
and women, he handed them over for imprisonment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now those who had been scattered went about
preaching the word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Philip went down to (the) city of Samaria
and proclaimed the Messiah to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With one accord, the crowds paid attention to
what was said by Philip when they heard it and saw the signs he was doing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For unclean spirits, crying out in a loud
voice, came out of many possessed people, and many paralyzed and crippled
people were cured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was great joy in that city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A man named Simon used to practice magic <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-414 href="__PY2.HTM#$414">4</a></sup></font></sup>
in the city and astounded the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All of them, from the least to the greatest,
paid attention to him, saying, &quot;This man is the 'Power of God' that is
called 'Great.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They paid attention to him because he had
astounded them by his magic for a long time, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but once they began to believe Philip as he
preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ,
men and women alike were baptized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even Simon himself believed and, after being
baptized, became devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds
that were occurring, he was astounded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that
Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent them Peter and John, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who went down and prayed for them, that they
might receive the holy Spirit, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for it had not yet fallen upon any of them;
they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-415 href="__PY2.HTM#$415">5</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they laid hands on them and they received
the holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-416 href="__PY2.HTM#$416">6</a></sup></font></sup> When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred
by the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said, &quot;Give me this power too, so that
anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Peter said to him, &quot;May your money
perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the gift of God with
money. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have no share or lot in this matter, for
your heart is not upright before God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Repent of this wickedness of yours and pray to
the Lord that, if possible, your intention may be forgiven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I see that you are filled with bitter gall
and are in the bonds of iniquity.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Simon said in reply, &quot;Pray for me to the
Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when they had testified and proclaimed the word
of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem and preached the good news to many
Samaritan villages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-417 href="__PY2.HTM#$417">7</a></sup></font></sup> Then the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip,
&quot;Get up and head south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza,
the desert route.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he got up and set out. Now there was an
Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of the Candace, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-418 href="__PY2.HTM#$418">8</a></sup></font></sup> that
is, the queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of her entire treasury, who had come
to Jerusalem to worship, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and was returning home. Seated in his chariot,
he was reading the prophet Isaiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Spirit said to Philip, &quot;Go and join up
with that chariot.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-419 href="__PY2.HTM#$419">9</a></sup></font></sup> Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the
prophet and said, &quot;Do you understand what you are reading?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He replied, &quot;How can I, unless someone
instructs me?&quot; So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This was the scripture passage he was reading:
&quot;Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its
shearer is silent, so he opened not his mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In (his) humiliation justice was denied him.
Who will tell of his posterity? For his life is taken from the earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the eunuch said to Philip in reply,
&quot;I beg you, about whom is the prophet saying this? About himself, or about
someone else?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Philip opened his mouth and, beginning
with this scripture passage, he proclaimed Jesus to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they traveled along the road they came to
some water, and the eunuch said, &quot;Look, there is water. What is to prevent
my being baptized?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-41A href="__PY2.HTM#$41A">10</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip
and the eunuch both went down into the water, and he baptized him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they came out of the water, the Spirit of
the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but continued on
his way rejoicing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Philip came to Azotus, and went about
proclaiming the good news to all the towns until he reached Caesarea. </p>

the persecution that now breaks out against the Jerusalem community can be
gathered from <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYG.HTM#GOSP.ACT.22.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 22:4 and
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYK.HTM#GOSP.ACT.26.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 26:9-11. Luke, however, concentrates on the
fortunes of the word of God among people, indicating how the dispersal of the
Jewish community resulted in the conversion of the Samaritans
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:4-17, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 25). His
narrative is further expanded to include the account of Philip's acceptance of
an Ethiopian (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:26-39).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$412 href="__PY2.HTM#-412">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [1] All were scattered . . . except
the apostles: this observation leads some modern scholars to conclude that the
persecution was limited to the Hellenist Christians and that the Hebrew Christians
were not molested, perhaps because their attitude toward the law and temple was
still more in line with that of their fellow Jews (see the charge leveled
against the Hellenist Stephen in Acts 6, 13-14). Whatever the facts, it appears
that the Twelve took no public stand regarding Stephen's position, choosing,
instead, to await the development of events. </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$413 href="__PY2.HTM#-413">3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3] Saul . . . was trying to
destroy the church: like Stephen, Saul was able to perceive that the Christian
movement contained the seeds of doctrinal divergence from Judaism. A pupil of
Gamaliel, according to <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYG.HTM#GOSP.ACT.22.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 22:3, and totally
dedicated to the law as the way of salvation (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P101.HTM#NTLET.GAL.1.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal
1:13-14), Saul accepted the task of crushing the Christian movement,
at least insofar as it detracted from the importance of the temple and the law.
His vehement opposition to Christianity reveals how difficult it was for a Jew
of his time to accept a messianism that differed so greatly from the general expectation.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$414 href="__PY2.HTM#-414">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [9-13,18-24] Sorcerers were well
known in the ancient world. Probably the incident involving Simon and his
altercation with Peter is introduced to show that the miraculous charisms
possessed by members of the Christian community (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
8:6-7) were not to be confused with the magic of sorcerers.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$415 href="__PY2.HTM#-415">5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [16] Here and in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY4.HTM#GOSP.ACT.10.44"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:44-48 and <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYD.HTM#GOSP.ACT.19.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
19:1-6, Luke distinguishes between baptism in the name of the Lord
Jesus and the reception of the Spirit. In each case, the Spirit is conferred
through members of the Twelve (Peter and John) or their representative (Paul).
This may be Luke's way of describing the role of the church in the bestowal of
the Spirit. Elsewhere in Acts, baptism and the Spirit are more closely related
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:5; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY5.HTM#GOSP.ACT.11.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 11:16).</p>

gift of God (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.20"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:20) with money. Peter's
cursing of Simon's attempt so to use his money expresses a typically Lucan
attitude toward material wealth (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWP.HTM#GOSP.LUK.6.24"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 6:24;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWV.HTM#GOSP.LUK.12.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 12:16-21; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWZ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.16.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16:13).</p>

conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch, Luke adduces additional evidence to show
that the spread of Christianity outside the confines of Judaism itself was in
accord with the plan of God. He does not make clear whether the Ethiopian was
originally a convert to Judaism or, as is more probable, a
&quot;God-fearer&quot; (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY4.HTM#GOSP.ACT.10.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 10:1), i.e., one who
accepted Jewish monotheism and ethic and attended the synagogue but did not
consider himself bound by other regulations such as circumcision and observance
of the dietary laws. The story of his conversion to Christianity is given a
strong supernatural cast by the introduction of an angel
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:26), instruction from the holy Spirit
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.29"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:29), and the strange removal of Philip
