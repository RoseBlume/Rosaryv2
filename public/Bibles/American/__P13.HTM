<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 37</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob settled in the land where his father had
stayed, the land of Canaan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is his family history. When Joseph was
seventeen years old, he was tending the flocks with his brothers; he was an
assistant to the sons of his father's wives Bilhah and Zilpah, and he brought
his father bad reports about them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons, for
he was the child of his old age; and he had made him a long tunic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his brothers saw that their father loved
him best of all his sons, they hated him so much that they would not even greet
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once Joseph had a dream, which he told to his
brothers: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Listen to this dream I had. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There we were, binding sheaves in the field,
when suddenly my sheaf rose to an upright position, and your sheaves formed a
ring around my sheaf and bowed down to it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Are you really going to make yourself
king over us?&quot; his brothers asked him. &quot;Or impose your rule on
us?&quot; So they hated him all the more because of his talk about his dreams. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he had another dream, and this one, too,
he told to his brothers. &quot;I had another dream,&quot; he said; &quot;this
time, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he also told it to his father, his father
reproved him. &quot;What is the meaning of this dream of yours?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Can it be that I and your mother and your brothers are to come and bow to
the ground before you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So his brothers were wrought up against him but
his father pondered the matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One day, when his brothers had gone to pasture
their father's flocks at Shechem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel said to Joseph, &quot;Your brothers, you
know, are tending our flocks at Shechem. Get ready; I will send you to
them.&quot; &quot;I am ready,&quot; Joseph answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go then,&quot; he replied; &quot;see if
all is well with your brothers and the flocks, and bring back word.&quot; So he
sent him off from the valley of Hebron. When Joseph reached Shechem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a man met him as he was wandering about in the
fields. &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; the man asked him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I am looking for my brothers,&quot; he
answered. &quot;Could you please tell me where they are tending the flocks?&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man told him, &quot;They have moved on from
here; in fact, I heard them say, 'Let us go on to Dothan.'&quot; So Joseph went
after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They noticed him from a distance, and before he
came up to them, they plotted to kill him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to one another: &quot;Here comes that
master dreamer! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one
of the cisterns here; we could say that a wild beast devoured him. We shall
then see what comes of his dreams.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5O href="__P13.HTM#$5O">1</a></sup></font></sup> When Reuben heard this, he tried to save him
from their hands, saying: &quot;We must not take his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead of shedding blood,&quot; he continued,
&quot;just throw him into that cistern there in the desert; but don't kill him
outright.&quot; His purpose was to rescue him from their hands and restore him
to his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when Joseph came up to them, they stripped
him of the long tunic he had on; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>then they took him and threw him into the
cistern, which was empty and dry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They then sat down to their meal. Looking up,
they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, their camels laden with
gum, balm and resin to be taken down to Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah said to his brothers: &quot;What is to be
gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rather, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites,
instead of doing away with him ourselves. After all, he is our brother, our own
flesh.&quot; His brothers agreed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5P href="__P13.HTM#$5P">2</a></sup></font></sup> They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty
pieces of silver. Some Midianite traders passed by, and they pulled Joseph up
out of the cistern and took him to Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Reuben went back to the cistern and saw
that Joseph was not in it, he tore his clothes, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and returning to his brothers, he exclaimed:
&quot;The boy is gone! And I - where can I turn?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took Joseph's tunic, and after
slaughtering a goat, dipped the tunic in its blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they sent someone to bring the long tunic
to their father, with the message: &quot;We found this. See whether it is your
son's tunic or not.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He recognized it and exclaimed: &quot;My son's
tunic! A wild beast has devoured him! Joseph has been torn to pieces!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jacob rent his clothes, put sackcloth on
his loins, and mourned his son many days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though his sons and daughters tried to console
him, he refused all consolation, saying, &quot;No, I will go down mourning to
my son in the nether world.&quot; Thus did his father lament him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Midianites, meanwhile, sold Joseph in Egypt
to Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh and his chief steward. </p>

the latter, Reuben tries to rescue Joseph, who is taken in Reuben's absence by
certain Midianites; in the Yahwist source, it is Judah who saves Joseph's life
by having him sold to certain Ishmaelites. Although the two variant forms in
which the story was handed down in early oral tradition differ in these minor
points, they agree on the essential fact that Joseph was brought as a slave
into Egypt because of the jealousy of his brothers.</p>
