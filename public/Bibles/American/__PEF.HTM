<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-169 href="__PEF.HTM#$169">1</a></sup></font></sup> Very soon afterward, Lysias, guardian and
kinsman of the king and head of the government, being greatly displeased at
what had happened, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>mustered about eighty thousand infantry and all
his cavalry and marched against the Jews. His plan was to make Jerusalem a
Greek settlement; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to levy tribute on the temple, as he did on the
sanctuaries of the other nations; and to put the high priesthood up for sale
every year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did not take God's power into account at
all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his
thousands of horsemen, and his eighty elephants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he invaded Judea, and when he reached
Beth-zur, a fortified place about twenty miles from Jerusalem, launched a
strong attack against it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Maccabeus and his men learned that Lysias was
besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with
lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Maccabeus himself was the first to take up
arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help
their kinsmen. Then they resolutely set out together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem,
a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing
gold weapons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all of them together thanked God for his
mercy, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to
assault not only men, but the most savage beasts, yes, even walls of iron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now that the Lord had shown his mercy toward
them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions,
they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred horsemen, and
put all the rest to flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Most of those who got away were wounded and
stripped of their arms, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Lysias was not a stupid man. He reflected
on the defeat he had suffered, and came to realize that the Hebrews were
invincible because the mighty God was their ally. He therefore sent a message </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>persuading them to settle everything on just
terms, and promising to persuade the king also, and to induce him to become
their friend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Maccabeus, solicitous for the common good,
agreed to all that Lysias proposed; and the king, on his part, granted in
behalf of the Jews all the written requests of Maccabeus to Lysias. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These are the terms of the letter which Lysias
wrote to the Jews: &quot;Lysias sends greetings to the Jewish people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>John and Absalom, your envoys, have presented
your signed communication and asked about the matters contained in it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whatever had to be referred to the king I
called to his attention, and the things that were acceptable he has granted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you maintain your loyalty to the government,
I will endeavor to further your interests in the future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the details of these matters I have
authorized my representatives, as well as your envoys, to confer with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16A href="__PEF.HTM#$16A">2</a></sup></font></sup> Farewell.&quot; The year one hundred and
forty-eight, the twenty-fourth of Dioscorinthius. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king's letter read thus: &quot;King
Antiochus sends greetings to his brother Lysias. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now that our father has taken his place among
the gods, we wish the subjects of our kingdom to be undisturbed in conducting
their own affairs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We understand that the Jews do not agree with
our father's policy concerning Greek customs but prefer their own way of life.
They are petitioning us to let them retain their own customs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since we desire that this people too should be
undisturbed, our decision is that their temple be restored to them and that
they live in keeping with the customs of their ancestors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly, please send them messengers to
give them our assurances of friendship, so that, when they learn of our
decision, they may have nothing to worry about but may contentedly go about
their own business.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king's letter to the people was as follows:
&quot;King Antiochus sends greetings to the Jewish senate and to the rest of
the Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you are well, it is what we desire. We too
are in good health. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Menelaus has told us of your wish to return
home and attend to your own affairs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, those who return by the thirtieth of
Xanthicus will have our assurance of full permission </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to observe their dietary laws and other laws,
just as before, and none of the Jews shall be molested in any way for faults
committed through ignorance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have also sent Menelaus to reassure you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16B href="__PEF.HTM#$16B">3</a></sup></font></sup> Farewell.&quot; In the year one hundred and
forty-eight, the fifteenth of Xanthicus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Romans also sent them a letter as follows:
&quot;Quintus Memmius and Titus Manius, legates of the Romans, send greetings
to the Jewish people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whatever Lysias, kinsman of the king, has
granted you, we also approve. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the matters on which he passed judgment
should be submitted to the king. As soon as you have considered them, send
someone to us with your decisions so that we may present them to your
advantage, for we are on our way to Antioch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Make haste, then, to send us those who can
inform us of your intentions. </p>
