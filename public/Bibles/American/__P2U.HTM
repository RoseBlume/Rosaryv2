<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B4 href="__P2U.HTM#$B4">2</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Take Aaron and his sons, together with
the vestments, the anointing oil, the bullock for a sin offering, the two rams,
and the basket of unleavened food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then assemble the whole community at the
entrance of the meeting tent.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Moses did as the LORD had commanded. When
the community had assembled at the entrance of the meeting tent, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses told them what the LORD had ordered to be
done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bringing forward Aaron and his sons, he first
washed them with water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he put the tunic on Aaron, girded him with
the sash, clothed him with the robe, placed the ephod on him, and girded him
with the embroidered belt of the ephod, fastening it around him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B5 href="__P2U.HTM#$B5">3</a></sup></font></sup> He then set the breastpiece on him, with the
Urim and Thummim in it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and put the miter on his head, attaching the
gold plate, the sacred diadem, over the front of the miter, at his forehead, as
the LORD had commanded him to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Taking the anointing oil, Moses anointed and
consecrated the Dwelling, with all that was in it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he sprinkled some of this oil seven times
on the altar, and anointed the altar, with all its appurtenances, and the
laver, with its base, thus consecrating them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also poured some of the anointing oil on
Aaron's head, thus consecrating him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses likewise brought forward Aaron's sons,
clothed them with tunics, girded them with sashes, and put turbans on them, as
the LORD had commanded him to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had brought forward the bullock for a
sin offering, Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses slaughtered it, and taking some of
its blood, with his finger he put it on the horns around the altar, thus
purifying the altar. He also made atonement for the altar by pouring out the
blood at its base when he consecrated it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Taking all the fat that was over the inner
organs, as well as the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat,
Moses burned them on the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The bullock, however, with its hide and flesh
and offal he burned in the fire outside the camp, as the LORD had commanded him
to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He next brought forward the holocaust ram, and
Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had slaughtered it, Moses splashed its
blood on all sides of the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After cutting up the ram into pieces, he burned
the head, the cut-up pieces and the suet; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>then, having washed the inner organs and the
shanks with water, he also burned these remaining parts of the ram on the altar
as a holocaust, a sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD, as the LORD had
commanded him to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he brought forward the second ram, the
ordination ram, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had slaughtered it, Moses took some of
its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right
hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses had the sons of Aaron also come forward,
and he put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of
their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. The rest of the
blood he splashed on the sides of the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then took the fat: the fatty tail and all
the fat over the inner organs, the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys with their
fat, and likewise the right leg; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>from the basket of unleavened food that was set
before the LORD he took one unleavened cake, one loaf of bread made with oil,
and one wafer; these he placed on top of the portions of fat and the right leg.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then put all these things into the hands of
Aaron and his sons, whom he had wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had received them back, Moses burned
them with the holocaust on the altar as the ordination offering, a
sweet-smelling oblation to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then took the breast and waved it as a wave
offering before the LORD; this was Moses' own portion of the ordination ram.
All this was in keeping with the LORD'S command to Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Taking some of the anointing oil and some of
the blood that was on the altar, Moses sprinkled with it Aaron and his
vestments, as well as his sons and their vestments, thus consecrating both
Aaron and his vestments and his sons and their vestments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally, Moses said to Aaron and his sons,
&quot;Boil the flesh at the entrance of the meeting tent, and there eat it with
the bread that is in the basket of the ordination offering, in keeping with the
command I have received: 'Aaron and his sons shall eat of it.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What is left over of the flesh and the bread
you shall burn up in the fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, you are not to depart from the
entrance of the meeting tent for seven days, until the days of your ordination
are completed; for your ordination is to last for seven days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-B6 href="__P2U.HTM#$B6">4</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD has commanded that what has been done
today be done to make atonement for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hence you must remain at the entrance of the
meeting tent day and night for seven days, carrying out the prescriptions of
the LORD; otherwise, you shall die; for this is the command I have
received.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Aaron and his sons did all that the LORD had
commanded through Moses. </p>

Either the verse gives merely the reason why God ordered this ceremony, or it contains
God's command that the same ceremony be used in all future ordinations, or it
decrees a repetition of the entire ceremony on each of the seven days. At least
a sin offering for atonement was made on each of these days. Cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P2A.HTM#PENT.EXO.29.29"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus
