<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11O href="__PDP.HTM#$11O">1</a></sup></font></sup> In those days Mattathias, son of John, son of
Simeon, a priest of the family of Joarib, left Jerusalem and settled in Modein.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had five sons: John, who was called Gaddi; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Simon, who was called Thassi; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judas, who was called Maccabeus; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Eleazar, who was called Avaran; and Jonathan,
who was called Apphus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he saw the sacrileges that were being
committed in Judah and in Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said: &quot;Woe is me! Why was I born to see
the ruin of my people and the ruin of the holy city, and to sit idle while it
is given into the hands of enemies, and the sanctuary into the hands of
strangers? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Her temple has become like a man
disgraced, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>her glorious ornaments have been carried off as
spoils, Her infants have been murdered in her streets, her young men by the
sword of the enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What nation has not taken its share of her
realm, and laid its hand on her possessions? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All her adornment has been taken away. From
being free, she has become a slave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We see our sanctuary and our beauty and our
glory laid waste, And the Gentiles have defiled them! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why are we still alive?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Mattathias and his sons tore their
garments, put on sackcloth, and mourned bitterly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The officers of the king in charge of enforcing
the apostasy came to the city of Modein to organize the sacrifices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Many of Israel joined them, but Mattathias and
his sons gathered in a group apart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the officers of the king addressed
Mattathias: &quot;You are a leader, an honorable and great man in this city,
supported by sons and kinsmen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11P href="__PDP.HTM#$11P">2</a></sup></font></sup> <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11Q href="__PDP.HTM#$11Q">3</a></sup></font></sup> Come now, be the first to
obey the king's command, as all the Gentiles and the men of Judah and those who
are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons shall be numbered among
the King's Friends, and shall be enriched with silver and gold and many
gifts.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Mattathias answered in a loud voice:
&quot;Although all the Gentiles in the king's realm obey him, so that each
forsakes the religion of his fathers and consents to the king's orders, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>yet I and my sons and my kinsmen will keep to
the covenant of our fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God forbid that we should forsake the law and
the commandments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We will not obey the words of the king nor depart
from our religion in the slightest degree.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he finished saying these words, a certain
Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein
according to the king's order. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Mattathias saw him, he was filled with
zeal; his heart was moved and his just fury was aroused; he sprang forward and
killed him upon the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the same time, he also killed the messenger
of the king who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus he showed his zeal for the law, just as
Phinehas did with Zimri, son of Salu. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Mattathias went through the city shouting,
&quot;Let everyone who is zealous for the law and who stands by the covenant
follow after me!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon he fled to the mountains with his
sons, leaving behind in the city all their possessions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11R href="__PDP.HTM#$11R">4</a></sup></font></sup> Many who sought to live according to
righteousness and religious custom went out into the desert to settle there, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they and their sons, their wives and their
cattle, because misfortunes pressed so hard on them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was reported to the officers and soldiers of
the king who were in the City of David, in Jerusalem, that certain men who had
flouted the king's order had gone out to the hiding places in the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Many hurried out after them, and having caught
up with them, camped opposite and prepared to attack them on the sabbath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Enough of this!&quot; the pursuers said
to them. &quot;Come out and obey the king's command, and your lives will be
spared.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they replied, &quot;We will not come out,
nor will we obey the king's command to profane the sabbath.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the enemy attacked them at once; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but they did not retaliate; they neither threw
stones, nor blocked up their own hiding places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said, &quot;Let us all die without
reproach; heaven and earth are our witnesses that you destroy us
unjustly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the officers and soldiers attacked them on
the sabbath, and they died with their wives, their children and their cattle,
to the number of a thousand persons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Mattathias and his friends heard of it,
they mourned deeply for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If we all do as our kinsmen have
done,&quot; they said to one another, &quot;and do not fight against the
Gentiles for our lives and our traditions, they will soon destroy us from the
earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On that day they came to this decision:
&quot;Let us fight against anyone who attacks us on the sabbath, so that we may
not all die as our kinsmen died in the hiding places.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11S href="__PDP.HTM#$11S">5</a></sup></font></sup> Then they were joined by a group of Hasideans,
valiant Israelites, all of them devout followers of the law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And all those who were fleeing from the
disaster joined them and supported them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They gathered an army and struck down sinners
in their anger and lawbreakers in their wrath, and the survivors fled to the
Gentiles for safety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Mattathias and his friends went about and tore
down the pagan altars; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they also enforced circumcision for any
uncircumcised boys whom they found in the territory of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They put to flight the arrogant, and the work
prospered in their hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They saved the law from the hands of the
Gentiles and of the kings and did not let the sinner triumph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the time came for Mattathias to die, he
said to his sons: &quot;Arrogance and scorn have now grown strong; it is a time
of disaster and violent anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, my sons, be zealous for the law and
give your lives for the covenant of our fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Remember the deeds that our fathers did
