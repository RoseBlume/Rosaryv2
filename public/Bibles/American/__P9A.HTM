<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab had seventy descendants in Samaria. Jehu
prepared letters and sent them to the city rulers, to the elders, and to the
guardians of Ahab's descendants in Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Since your master's sons are with
you,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and you have the chariots, the horses, a fortified
city, and the weapons, when this letter reaches you </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>decide which is the best and the fittest of
your master's offspring, place him on his father's throne, and fight for your
master's house.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were overcome with fright and said,
&quot;If two kings could not withstand him, how can we?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the vizier and the ruler of the city, along
with the elders and the guardians, sent this message to Jehu: &quot;We are your
servants, and we will do everything you tell us. We will proclaim no one king;
do whatever you think best.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jehu wrote them a second letter: &quot;If
you are on my side and will obey me, count the heads of your master's sons and
come to me in Jezreel at this time tomorrow.&quot; (The seventy princes were in
the care of prominent men of the city, who were rearing them.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the letter arrived, they took the princes
and slew all seventy of them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu
in Jezreel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;They have brought the heads of the
princes,&quot; a messenger came in and told him. &quot;Pile them in two heaps
at the entrance of the city until morning,&quot; he ordered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Going out in the morning, he stopped and said
to all the people: &quot;You are not responsible, and although I conspired
against my lord and slew him, yet who killed all these? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Know that not a single word which the LORD has spoken
against the house of Ahab shall go unfulfilled. The LORD has accomplished all
that he foretold through his servant Elijah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Jehu slew all who were left of the
family of Ahab in Jezreel, as well as all his powerful supporters, intimates,
and priests, leaving him no survivor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he set out for Samaria, and at
Beth-eked-haroim on the way, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he came across kinsmen of Ahaziah, king of
Judah. &quot;Who are you?&quot; he asked. &quot;We are kinsmen of
Ahaziah,&quot; they replied. &quot;We are going down to visit the princes and
the family of the queen mother.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Take them alive,&quot; Jehu ordered. They
were taken alive, forty-two in number, then slain at the pit of Beth-eked. Not
one of them was spared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had left there, Jehu met Jehonadab, son
of Rechab, on the road. He greeted him and asked, &quot;Are you sincerely
disposed toward me, as I am toward you?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied
Jehonadab. &quot;If you are,&quot; continued Jehu, &quot;give me your
hand.&quot; Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu drew him up into his chariot.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Come with me,&quot; he said, &quot;and
see my zeal for the LORD.&quot; And he took him along in his own chariot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he arrived in Samaria, Jehu slew all who
remained there of Ahab's line, doing away with them completely and thus
fulfilling the prophecy which the LORD had spoken to Elijah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehu gathered all the people together and said
to them: &quot;Ahab served Baal to some extent, but Jehu will serve him yet
more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now summon for me all Baal's prophets, all his
worshipers, and all his priests. See that no one is absent, for I have a great
sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is absent shall not live.&quot; This Jehu did as a
ruse, so that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehu said further, &quot;Proclaim a solemn
assembly in honor of Baal.&quot; They did so, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Jehu sent word of it throughout the land of
Israel. All the worshipers of Baal without exception came into the temple of
Baal, which was filled to capacity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehu said to the custodian of the
wardrobe, &quot;Bring out the garments for all the worshipers of Baal.&quot;
When he had brought out the garments for them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehu, with Jehonadab, son of Rechab, entered
the temple of Baal and said to the worshipers of Baal, &quot;Search and be sure
that there is no worshiper of the LORD here with you, but only worshipers of
Baal.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they proceeded to offer sacrifices and
holocausts. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside with this warning,
&quot;If one of you lets anyone escape of those whom I shall deliver into your
hands, he shall pay life for life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as he finished offering the holocaust,
Jehu said to the guards and officers, &quot;Go in and slay them. Let no one
escape.&quot; So the guards and officers put them to the sword and cast them
out. Afterward they went into the inner shrine of the temple of Baal, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>took out the stele of Baal, and burned the
shrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they smashed the stele of Baal, tore down
the building, and turned it into a latrine, as it remains today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Jehu rooted out the worship of Baal from
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, he did not desist from the sins which
Jeroboam, son of Nebat, had caused Israel to commit, as regards the golden
calves at Bethel and at Dan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Jehu, &quot;Because you have
done well what I deem right, and have treated the house of Ahab as I desire,
your sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jehu was not careful to observe
wholeheartedly the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, since he did not desist
from the sins which Jeroboam caused Israel to commit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time the LORD began to dismember
Israel. Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their territory </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>east of the Jordan (all the land of Gilead, of
the Gadites, Reubenites and Manassehites), from Aroer on the river Arnon up
through Gilead and Bashan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jehu, his valor and all
his accomplishments, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried
in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The length of Jehu's reign over Israel in
Samaria was twenty-eight years. </p>
