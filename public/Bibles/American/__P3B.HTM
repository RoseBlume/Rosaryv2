</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Speak to the Israelites and tell them:
When you enter the land that I am giving you, let the land, too, keep a sabbath
for the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For six years you may sow your field, and for
six years prune your vineyard, gathering in their produce. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But during the seventh year the land shall have
a complete rest, a sabbath for the LORD, when you may neither sow your field
nor prune your vineyard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CL href="__P3B.HTM#$CL">1</a></sup></font></sup> The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not
reap, nor shall you pick the grapes of your untrimmed vines in this year of
sabbath rest for the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While the land has its sabbath, all its produce
will be food equally for you yourself and for your male and female slaves, for
your hired help and the tenants who live with you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and likewise for your livestock and for the
wild animals on your land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Seven weeks of years shall you count -
seven times seven years - so that the seven cycles amount to forty-nine years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, on the tenth day of the seventh month let
the trumpet resound; on this, the Day of Atonement, the trumpet blast shall
re-echo throughout your land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-CM href="__P3B.HTM#$CM">2</a></sup></font></sup> This fiftieth year you shall make sacred by
proclaiming liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee
for you, when every one of you shall return to his own property, every one to
his own family estate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In this fiftieth year, your year of jubilee,
you shall not sow, nor shall you reap the aftergrowth or pick the grapes from
the untrimmed vines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since this is the jubilee, which shall be
sacred for you, you may not eat of its produce, except as taken directly from
the field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;In this year of jubilee, then, every one
of you shall return to his own property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, when you sell any land to your
neighbor or buy any from him, do not deal unfairly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the basis of the number of years since the
last jubilee shall you purchase the land from him; and so also, on the basis of
the number of years for crops, shall he sell it to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the years are many, the price shall be so
much the more; when the years are few, the price shall be so much the less. For
it is really the number of crops that he sells you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not deal unfairly, then; but stand in fear
of your God. I, the LORD, am your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Observe my precepts and be careful to
keep my regulations, for then you will dwell securely in the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The land will yield its fruit and you will have
food in abundance, so that you may live there without worry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, do not say, 'What shall we eat in
the seventh year, if we do not then sow or reap our crop?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will bestow such blessings on you in the
sixth year that there will then be crop enough for three years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you sow in the eighth year, you will
continue to eat from the old crop; and even into the ninth year, when the crop
comes in, you will still have the old to eat from. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The land shall not be sold in perpetuity;
for the land is mine, and you are but aliens who have become my tenants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, in every part of the country that
you occupy, you must permit the land to be redeemed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When one of your countrymen is reduced to
poverty and has to sell some of his property, his closest relative, who has the
right to redeem it, may go and buy back what his kinsman has sold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, however, the man has no relative to redeem
his land, but later on acquires sufficient means to buy it back in his own
name, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he shall make a deduction from the price in
proportion to the number of years since the sale, and then pay back the balance
to the one to whom he sold it, so that he may thus regain his own property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if he does not acquire sufficient means to
buy back his land, what he has sold shall remain in the possession of the
purchaser until the jubilee, when it must be released and returned to its
original owner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When someone sells a dwelling in a walled
town, he has the right to buy it back during the time of one full year from its
sale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if such a house in a walled town has not
been redeemed at the end of a full year, it shall belong in perpetuity to the
purchaser and his descendants; nor shall it be released in the jubilee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, houses in villages that are not
encircled by walls shall be considered as belonging to the surrounding farm
land; they may be redeemed at any time, and in the jubilee they must be
released. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;In levitical cities the Levites shall
always have the right to redeem the town houses that are their property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Any town house of the Levites in their cities
that had been sold and not redeemed, shall be released in the jubilee; for the
town houses of the Levites are their hereditary property in the midst of the
Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, the pasture land belonging to their
cities shall not be sold at all; it must always remain their hereditary
property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When one of your fellow countrymen is
reduced to poverty and is unable to hold out beside you, extend to him the
privileges of an alien or a tenant, so that he may continue to live with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not exact interest from your countryman
either in money or in kind, but out of fear of God let him live with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You are to lend him neither money at interest
nor food at a profit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I, the LORD, am your God, who brought you out
of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When, then, your countryman becomes so
impoverished beside you that he sells you his services, do not make him work as
a slave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rather, let him be like a hired servant or like
your tenant, working with you until the jubilee year, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when he, together with his children, shall be
released from your service and return to his kindred and to the property of his
ancestors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since those whom I brought out of the land of
Egypt are servants of mine, they shall not be sold as slaves to any man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not lord it over them harshly, but stand in
fear of your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Slaves, male and female, you may indeed
possess, provided you buy them from among the neighboring nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You may also buy them from among the aliens who
reside with you and from their children who are born and reared in your land.
Such slaves you may own as chattels, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and leave to your sons as their hereditary
property, making them perpetual slaves. But you shall not lord it harshly over
any of the Israelites, your kinsmen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When one of your countrymen is reduced to
such poverty that he sells himself to a wealthy alien who has a permanent or a
temporary residence among you, or to one of the descendants of an immigrant
family, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>even after he has thus sold his services he
still has the right of redemption; he may be redeemed by one of his own
brothers, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>or by his uncle or cousin, or by some other
relative or fellow clansman; or, if he acquires the means, he may redeem
himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With his purchaser he shall compute the years from
the sale to the jubilee, distributing the sale price over these years as though
he had been hired as a day laborer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The more such years there are, the more of the
sale price he shall pay back as ransom; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the fewer years there are left before the
jubilee year, the more he has to his credit; in proportion to his years of
service shall he pay his ransom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The alien shall treat him as a servant hired on
an annual basis, and he shall not lord it over him harshly under your very
eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he is not thus redeemed, he shall
nevertheless be released, together with his children, in the jubilee year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For to me the Israelites belong as servants;
they are servants of mine, because I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I,
the LORD, your God. </p>
