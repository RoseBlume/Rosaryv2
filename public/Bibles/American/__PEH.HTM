<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16K href="__PEH.HTM#$16K">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas
and his men learned that Antiochus Eupator was invading Judea with a large
force, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16L href="__PEH.HTM#$16L">2</a></sup></font></sup> and that with him was Lysias, his guardian, who
was in charge of the government. They led a Greek army of one hundred and ten
thousand foot soldiers, fifty-three hundred horsemen, twenty-two elephants, and
three hundred chariots armed with scythes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Menelaus also joined them, and with great
duplicity kept urging Antiochus on, not for the welfare of his country, but in
the hope of being established in office. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16M href="__PEH.HTM#$16M">3</a></sup></font></sup> But the King of kings aroused the anger of
Antiochus against the scoundrel. When the king was shown by Lysias that
Menelaus was to blame for all the trouble, he ordered him to be taken to Beroea
and executed there in the customary local method. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16N href="__PEH.HTM#$16N">4</a></sup></font></sup> There is at that place a tower seventy-five
feet high, full of ashes, with a circular rim sloping down steeply on all sides
toward the ashes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A man guilty of sacrilege or notorious for
certain other crimes is brought up there and then hurled down to destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In such a manner was Menelaus, the transgressor
of the law, fated to die; he was deprived even of decent burial. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was altogether just that he who had
committed so many sins against the altar with its pure fire and ashes should
meet his death in ashes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king was advancing, his mind full of savage
plans for inflicting on the Jews worse things than those they suffered in his
father's time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Judas learned of this, he urged the people
to call upon the LORD night and day, to help them now, if ever, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when they were about to be deprived of their
law, their country, and their holy temple; and not to allow this nation, which
had just begun to revive, to be subjected again to blasphemous Gentiles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had all joined in doing this, and had
implored the merciful LORD continuously with weeping and fasting and
prostrations for three days, Judas encouraged them and told them to stand
ready. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After a private meeting with the elders, he
decided that, before the king's army could invade Judea and take possession of
the city, the Jews should march out and settle the matter with God's help. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Leaving the outcome to the Creator of the
world, and exhorting his followers to fight nobly to death for the laws, the
temple, the city, the country, and the government, he pitched his camp near
Modein. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16O href="__PEH.HTM#$16O">5</a></sup></font></sup> Giving his men the battle cry &quot;God's
Victory,&quot; he made a night attack on the king's pavilion with a picked
force of the bravest young men and killed about two thousand in the camp. They
also slew the lead elephant and its rider. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16P href="__PEH.HTM#$16P">6</a></sup></font></sup> Finally they withdrew in triumph, having filled
the camp with terror and confusion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Day was just breaking when this was
accomplished with the help and protection of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king, having had a taste of the Jews'
daring, tried to take their positions by a stratagem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he marched against Beth-zur, a strong
fortress of the Jews; but he was driven back, checked, and defeated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judas then sent supplies to the men inside, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16Q href="__PEH.HTM#$16Q">7</a></sup></font></sup> but Rhodocus, of the Jewish army, betrayed
military secrets to the enemy. He was found out, arrested, and imprisoned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king made a second attempt by negotiating
with the men of Beth-zur. After giving them his pledge and receiving theirs, he
withdrew </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and attacked Judas and his men. But he was
defeated. Next he heard that Philip, who was left in charge of the government
in Antioch had rebelled. Dismayed, he parleyed with the Jews, submitted to
their terms, and swore to observe their rights. Having come to this agreement,
he offered a sacrifice, and honored the temple with a generous donation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-16R href="__PEH.HTM#$16R">8</a></sup></font></sup> He approved of Maccabeus and left him as
military and civil governor of the territory from Ptolemais to the region of
the Gerrenes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he came to Ptolemais, the people of that
city were angered by the peace treaty; in fact they were so indignant that they
wanted to annul its provisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Lysias took the platform, defended the
treaty as well as he could and won them over by persuasion. After calming them
and gaining their good will, he returned to Antioch. That is how the king's
attack and withdrawal went. </p>
