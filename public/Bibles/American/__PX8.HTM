<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>John</i></b><b><br>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p>

<p>The Gospel according
to John is quite different in character from the three synoptic gospels. It is
highly literary and symbolic. It does not follow the same order or reproduce
the same stories as the synoptic gospels. To a much greater degree, it is the
product of a developed theological reflection and grows out of a different
circle and tradition. It was probably written in the 90s of the first century.</p>

<p>The Gospel of John begins
with a magnificent prologue, which states many of the major themes and motifs
of the gospel, much as an overture does for a musical work. The prologue
proclaims Jesus as the preexistent and incarnate Word of God who has revealed
the Father to us. The rest of the first chapter forms the introduction to the
gospel proper and consists of the Baptist's testimony about Jesus (there is no
baptism of Jesus in this gospel - John simply points him out as the Lamb of
God), followed by stories of the call of the first disciples, in which various
titles predicated of Jesus in the early church are presented.</p>

<p>The gospel narrative
contains a series of &quot;signs&quot; - the gospel's word for the wondrous
deeds of Jesus. The author is primarily interested in the significance of these
deeds, and so interprets them for the reader by various reflections, narratives,
and discourses. The first sign is the transformation of water into wine at Cana
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXA.HTM#GOSP.JOH.2.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 2:1-11); this represents the replacement of
the Jewish ceremonial washings and symbolizes the entire creative and
transforming work of Jesus. The second sign, the cure of the royal official's
son (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXC.HTM#GOSP.JOH.4.46"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 4:46-54) simply by the word of Jesus at
a distance, signifies the power of Jesus' life-giving word. The same theme is
further developed by other signs, probably for a total of seven. The third
sign, the cure of the paralytic at the pool with five porticoes in ch 5,
continues the theme of water offering newness of life. In the preceding
chapter, to the woman at the well in Samaria Jesus had offered living water
springing up to eternal life, a symbol of the revelation that Jesus brings;
here Jesus' life-giving word replaces the water of the pool that failed to
bring life. John 6 contains two signs, the multiplication of loaves and the
walking on the waters of the Sea of Galilee. These signs are connected much as
the manna and the crossing of the Red Sea are in the Passover narrative and
symbolize a new exodus. The multiplication of the loaves is interpreted for the
reader by the discourse that follows, where the bread of life is used first as
a figure for the revelation of God in Jesus and then for the Eucharist. After a
series of dialogues reflecting Jesus' debates with the Jewish authorities at
the Feast of Tabernacles in John 7; 8, the sixth sign is presented in John 9,
the sign of the young man born blind. This is a narrative illustration of the
theme of conflict in the preceding two chapters; it proclaims the triumph of
light over darkness, as Jesus is presented as the Light of the world. This is
interpreted by a narrative of controversy between the Pharisees and the young
man who had been given his sight by Jesus, ending with a discussion of
spiritual blindness and spelling out the symbolic meaning of the cure. And
finally, the seventh sign, the raising of Lazarus in ch 11, is the climax of
signs. Lazarus is presented as a token of the real life that Jesus, the
Resurrection and the Life, who will now ironically be put to death because of
his gift of life to Lazarus, will give to all who believe in him once he has
been raised from the dead.</p>

<p>After the account of the
seven signs, the &quot;hour&quot; of Jesus arrives, and the author passes from
sign to reality, as he moves into the discourses in the upper room that
interpret the meaning of the passion, death, and resurrection narratives that
follow. The whole gospel of John is a progressive revelation of the glory of
God's only Son, who comes to reveal the Father and then returns in glory to the
Father. The author's purpose is clearly expressed in what must have been the
original ending of the gospel at the end of John 20: &quot;Now Jesus did many
other signs in the presence of [his] disciples that are not written in this
book. But these are written that you may [come to] believe that Jesus is the
Messiah, the Son of God, and that through this belief you may have life in his
name.&quot;</p>

<p>Critical analysis makes it
difficult to accept the idea that the gospel as it now stands was written by
one person. John 21 seems to have been added after the gospel was completed; it
exhibits a Greek style somewhat different from that of the rest of the work.
The prologue (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX9.HTM#GOSP.JOH.1.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 1:1-18) apparently contains an
independent hymn, subsequently adapted to serve as a preface to the gospel.
Within the gospel itself there are also some inconsistencies, e.g., there are
two endings of Jesus' discourse in the upper room (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXM.HTM#GOSP.JOH.14.31"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
14:31; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXQ.HTM#GOSP.JOH.18.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 18:1). To solve these problems,
scholars have proposed various rearrangements that would produce a smoother
order. However, most have come to the conclusion that the inconsistencies were
probably produced by subsequent editing in which homogeneous materials were
added to a shorter original.</p>

<p>Other difficulties for any
theory of eyewitness authorship of the gospel in its present form are presented
by its highly developed theology and by certain elements of its literary style.
For instance, some of the wondrous deeds of Jesus have been worked into highly
effective dramatic scenes (John 9); there has been a careful attempt to have
these followed by discourses that explain them (John 5; 6); and the sayings of
Jesus have been oven into long discourses of a quasi-poetic form resembling the
speeches of personified Wisdom in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>The gospel contains many
details about Jesus not found in the synoptic gospels, e.g., that Jesus engaged
in a baptizing ministry (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXB.HTM#GOSP.JOH.3.22"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 3:22) before he
changed to one of preaching and signs; that Jesus' public ministry lasted for
several years (see the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXA.HTM#GOSP.JOH.2.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 2:13); that he
traveled to Jerusalem for various festivals and met serious opposition long
before his death (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXA.HTM#GOSP.JOH.2.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 2:14-25; 5; 7-8); and that
he was put to death on the day before Passover (John l<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXG.HTM#GOSP.JOH.8.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 8:28).
These events are not always in chronological order because of the development
and editing that took place. However, the accuracy of much of the detail of the
fourth gospel constitutes a strong argument that the Johannine tradition rests
upon the testimony of an eyewitness. Although tradition identified this person
as John, the son of Zebedee, most modern scholars find that the evidence does
not support this.</p>

<p>The fourth gospel is not
simply history; the narrative has been organized and adapted to serve the
evangelist's theological purposes as well. Among them are the opposition to the
synagogue of the day and to John the Baptist's followers, who tried to exalt
their master at Jesus' expense, the desire to show that Jesus was the Messiah,
and the desire to convince Christians that their religious belief and practice
must be rooted in Jesus. Such theological purposes have impelled the evangelist
to emphasize motifs that were not so clear in the synoptic account of Jesus'
ministry, e.g., the explicit emphasis on his divinity.</p>

<p>The polemic between
synagogue and church produced bitter and harsh invective, especially regarding
the hostility toward Jesus of the authorities - Pharisees and Sadducees - who
are combined and referred to frequently as &quot;the Jews&quot; (see the note
on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX9.HTM#GOSP.JOH.1.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 1:19). These opponents are even described
in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXG.HTM#GOSP.JOH.8.44"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 8:44 as springing from their father the
devil, whose conduct they imitate in opposing God by rejecting Jesus, whom God
has sent. On the other hand, the author of this gospel seems to take pains to
show that women are not inferior to men in the Christian community: the woman
at the well in Samaria (John 4) is presented as a prototype of a missionary
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXC.HTM#GOSP.JOH.4.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 4:4-42), and the first witness of the
resurrection is a woman (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXS.HTM#GOSP.JOH.20.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 20:11-18).</p>

<p>The final editing of the
gospel and arrangement in its present form probably dates from between A.D. 90
and 100. Traditionally, Ephesus has been favored as the place of composition,
though many support a location in Syria, perhaps the city of Antioch, while
some have suggested other places, including Alexandria.</p>

<p>The principal divisions of
the Gospel according to John are the following:</p>
