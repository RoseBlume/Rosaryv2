<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 13</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A man of God came from Judah to Bethel by the
word of the LORD, while Jeroboam was standing at the altar to offer sacrifice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He cried out against the altar the word of the
LORD: &quot;O altar, altar, the LORD says, 'A child shall be born to the house
of David, Josiah by name, who shall slaughter upon you the priests of the high
places who offer sacrifice upon you, and he shall burn human bones upon
you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He gave a sign that same day and said:
&quot;This is the sign that the LORD has spoken: The altar shall break up and
the ashes on it shall be strewn about. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God
was crying out against the altar, he stretched forth his hand from the altar
and said, &quot;Seize him!&quot; But the hand he stretched forth against him
withered, so that he could not draw it back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, the altar broke up and the ashes from
it were strewn about - the sign the man of God had given as the word of the
LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king appealed to the man of God.
&quot;Entreat the LORD, your God,&quot; he said, &quot;and intercede for me
that I may be able to withdraw my hand.&quot; So the man of God entreated the
LORD, and the king recovered the normal use of his hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Come home with me for some
refreshment,&quot; the king invited the man of God, &quot;and I will give you a
present.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If you gave me half your kingdom,&quot;
the man of God said to the king, &quot;I would not go with you, nor eat bread
or drink water in this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I was instructed by the word of the LORD
not to eat bread or drink water and not to return by the way I came.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he departed by another road and did not go
back the way he had come to Bethel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was an old prophet living in the city,
whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in
Bethel. When they repeated to their father the words he had spoken to the king,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the father asked them, &quot;Which way did he
go?&quot; And his sons pointed out to him the road taken by the man of God who
had come from Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to his sons, &quot;Saddle the ass
for me.&quot; When they had saddled it, he mounted </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and followed the man of God, whom he found
seated under a terebinth. When he asked him, &quot;Are you the man of God who
came from Judah?&quot; he answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said, &quot;Come home with me and have
some bread.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I cannot go back with you, and I cannot
eat bread or drink water with you in this place,&quot; he answered, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;for I was told by the word of the LORD
neither to eat bread nor drink water here, and not to go back the way I
came.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he said to him, &quot;I, too, am a prophet like
you, and an angel told me in the word of the LORD to bring you back with me to
my house and to have you eat bread and drink water.&quot; He was lying to him,
however. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went back with him, and ate bread and
drank water in his house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But while they were sitting at table, the LORD
spoke to the prophet who had brought him back, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he cried out to the man of God who had come
from Judah: &quot;The LORD says, 'Because you rebelled against the command of
the LORD and did not keep the command which the LORD, your God, gave you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but returned and ate bread and drank water in
the place where he told you to do neither, your corpse shall not be brought to
the grave of your ancestors.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After he had eaten bread and drunk water, the
ass was saddled for him, and he again </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>set out. But a lion met him on the road, and
killed him. His corpse lay sprawled on the road, and the ass remained standing
by it, and so did the lion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some passers-by saw the body lying in the road,
with the lion standing beside it, and carried the news to the city where the
old prophet lived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On hearing it, the prophet who had brought him
back from his journey said: &quot;It is the man of God who rebelled against the
command of the LORD. He has delivered him to a lion, which mangled and killed
him, as the LORD predicted to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to his sons, &quot;Saddle the ass
for me.&quot; When they had saddled it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he went off and found the body lying in the
road with the ass and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the
body nor had it harmed the ass. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet lifted up the body of the man of
God and put it on the ass, and brought it back to the city to mourn over it and
to bury it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He laid the man's body in his own grave, and
they mourned over it: &quot;Alas, my brother!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After he had buried him, he said to his sons,
&quot;When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried. Lay my
remains beside his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the word of the LORD which he proclaimed against
the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the
cities of Samaria shall certainly come to pass.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam did not give up his evil ways after
this event, but again made priests for the high places from among the common
people. Whoever desired it was consecrated and became a priest of the high
places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This was a sin on the part of the house of
Jeroboam for which it was to be cut off and destroyed from the earth. </p>
