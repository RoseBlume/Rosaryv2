<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 20</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ben-hadad, king of Aram, gathered all his
forces, and accompanied by thirty-two kings with horses and chariotry, proceeded
to invest and attack Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent couriers to Ahab, king of Israel,
within the city, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to him, &quot;This is Ben-hadad's
message: 'Your silver and gold are mine, and your wives and your promising sons
are mine.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel answered, &quot;As you say,
my lord king, I and all I have are yours.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the couriers came again and said,
&quot;This is Ben-hadad's message: 'I sent you word to give me your silver and
gold, your wives and your sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, however, at this time tomorrow I will send
my servants to you, and they shall ransack your house and the houses of your
servants. They shall seize and take away whatever they consider
valuable.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel then summoned all the elders
of the land and said: &quot;Understand clearly that this man wants to ruin us.
When he sent to me for my wives and sons, my silver and my gold, I did not
refuse him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the elders and all the people said to him,
&quot;Do not listen. Do not give in.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly he directed the couriers of
Ben-hadad, &quot;Say to my lord the king, 'I will do all that you demanded of
your servant the first time. But this I cannot do.'&quot; The couriers left and
reported this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ben-hadad then sent him the message, &quot;May
the gods do thus and so to me if there is enough dust in Samaria to make
handfuls for all my followers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel replied, &quot;Tell him, 'It
is not for the man who is buckling his armor to boast as though he were taking
it off.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ben-hadad was drinking in the pavilions with
the kings when he heard this reply. &quot;Prepare the assault,&quot; he
commanded his servants; and they made ready to storm the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then a prophet came up to Ahab, king of Israel
and said: &quot;The LORD says, 'Do you see all this huge army? When I deliver
it up to you today, you will know that I am the LORD.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Ahab asked, &quot;Through whom will it be
delivered up?&quot; He answered, &quot;The LORD says, 'Through the retainers of
the governors of the provinces.'&quot; Then Ahab asked, &quot;Who is to
attack?&quot; He replied, &quot;You are.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Ahab called up the retainers of the
governors of the provinces, two hundred thirty-two of them. Behind them he
mustered all the Israelite soldiery, who numbered seven thousand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They marched out at noon, while Ben-hadad was
drinking heavily in the pavilions with the thirty-two kings who were his
allies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the retainers of the governors of the
provinces marched out first, Ben-hadad received word that some men had marched
out of Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He answered, &quot;Whether they have come out
for peace or for war, in any case take them alive.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when these had come out of the city - the
soldiers of the governors of the provinces with the army following them -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>each of them struck down his man. The Arameans
fled with Israel pursuing them, while Ben-hadad, king of Aram, escaped on a
chariot steed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel went out, took the horses
and chariots, and inflicted a severe defeat on Aram. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SE href="__P8Y.HTM#$SE">1</a></sup></font></sup> Then the prophet went up to the king of Israel
and said to him: &quot;Go, regroup your forces. Mark well what you do, for at
the beginning of the year the king of Aram will attack you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the other hand, the servants of the king of
Aram said to him: &quot;Their gods are gods of mountains. That is why they
defeated us. But if we fight them on level ground, we shall be sure to defeat
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is what you must do: Take the kings from
their posts and put prefects in their places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Mobilize an army as large as the army that has
deserted you, horse for horse, chariot for chariot. Let us fight them on level
ground, and we shall surely defeat them.&quot; He took their advice and did
this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the beginning of the year, Ben-hadad
mobilized Aram and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites, too, were called to arms and
supplied with provisions; then they went out to engage the foe. The Israelites,
encamped opposite them, seemed like a couple of small flocks of goats, while
Aram covered the countryside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A man of God came up and said to the king of
Israel: &quot;The LORD says, 'Because Aram has said the LORD is a god of
mountains, not a god of plains, I will deliver up to you all this large army,
that you may know I am the LORD.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were encamped opposite each other for seven
days. On the seventh day battle was joined, and the Israelites struck down one
hundred thousand foot soldiers of Aram in one day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The survivors, twenty-seven thousand of them,
fled into the city of Aphek, and there the wall collapsed. Ben-hadad, too,
fled, and took refuge within the city, in an inside room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servants said to him: &quot;We have heard
that the kings of the land of Israel are merciful kings. Allow us, therefore,
to garb ourselves in sackcloth, with cords around our heads, and go out to the
king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they dressed in sackcloth girded at the
waist, and wearing cords around their heads, they went to the king of Israel.
&quot;Your servant Ben-hadad pleads for his life,&quot; they said. &quot;Is he
still alive?&quot; the king asked. &quot;He is my brother.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hearing this as a good omen, the men quickly
took him at his word and said, &quot;Ben-hadad is your brother.&quot; He
answered, &quot;Go and get him.&quot; When Ben-hadad came out to him, the king
had him mount his chariot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ben-hadad said to him, &quot;I will restore the
cities which my father took from your father, and you may make yourself bazaars
in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.&quot; &quot;On these terms,&quot;
Ahab replied, &quot;I will set you free.&quot; So he made an agreement with him
and then set him free. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of the guild prophets was prompted by the
LORD to say to his companion, &quot;Strike me.&quot; But he refused to strike
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to him, &quot;Since you did not
obey the voice of the LORD, a lion will kill you when you leave me.&quot; When
they parted company, a lion came upon him and killed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet met another man and said,
&quot;Strike me.&quot; The man struck him a blow and wounded him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet went on and waited for the king on
the road, having disguised himself with a bandage over his eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the king was passing, he called out to the
king and said: &quot;Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and
suddenly someone turned and brought me a man and said, 'Guard this man. If he
is missing, you shall have to pay for his life with your life or pay out a
talent of silver.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But while your servant was looking here and
there, the man disappeared.&quot; The king of Israel said to him, &quot;That is
your sentence. You have decided it yourself.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He immediately removed the bandage from his
eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to him: &quot;The LORD says, 'Because
you have set free the man I doomed to destruction, your life shall pay for his
life, your people for his people.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Disturbed and angry, the king of Israel went
off homeward and entered Samaria. </p>
