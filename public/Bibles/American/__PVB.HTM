reigned from 37 to 4 B.C. Magi: originally a designation of the Persian
priestly caste, the word became used of those who were regarded as having more
than human knowledge. Matthew's magi are astrologers. </p>

ancient belief that a new star appeared at the time of a ruler's birth. Matthew
also draws upon the Old Testament story of Balaam, who had prophesied that

imminent birth of one who will deliver Israel from Egypt and the king makes
plans to destroy him. <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVB.HTM#GOSP.MAT.2.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 2:11: Cf

called out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus; Jesus, the Son of God, will similarly
be called out of that land in a new exodus. The father-son relationship between
God and the nation is set in a higher key. Here the son is not a group adopted
as &quot;son of God,&quot; but the child who, as conceived by the holy Spirit,
stands in unique relation to God. He is son of David and of Abraham, of Mary
and of Joseph, but, above all, of God.</p>

31:15 portrays Rachel, wife of the patriarch Jacob, weeping for her
children taken into exile at the time of the Assyrian invasion of the northern
kingdom (722-21 B.C.). Bethlehem was traditionally identified with Ephrath, the
place near which Rachel was buried (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11.HTM#PENT.GEN.35.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis

established, and Matthew sees it as being in accordance with the foreannounced
plan of God. The town of Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and no
such prophecy can be found there. The vague expression &quot;through the
prophets&quot; may be due to Matthew's seeing a connection between Nazareth and
certain texts in which there are words with a remote similarity to the name of
that town. Some such Old Testament texts are <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNU.HTM#PROPHB.ISA.11.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah
11:1 where the Davidic king of the future is called &quot;a bud&quot;
