<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During his reign Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, moved against him, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years.
Then Jehoiakim turned and rebelled against him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD loosed against him bands of Chaldeans,
Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites; he loosed them against Judah to destroy it,
as the LORD had threatened through his servants the prophets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This befell Judah because the LORD had stated
that he would inexorably put them out of his sight for the sins Manasseh had
committed in all that he did; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and especially because of the innocent blood he
shed, with which he filled Jerusalem, the LORD would not forgive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, with all
that he did, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiakim rested with his ancestors, and his
son Jehoiachin succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Egypt did not again leave his own
land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt
from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UE href="__P9O.HTM#$UE">1</a></sup></font></sup> Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Nehushta, daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
his forebears had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time the officials of Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, attacked Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, himself arrived
at the city while his servants were besieging it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiachin, king of Judah, together with
his mother, his ministers, officers, and functionaries, surrendered to the king
of Babylon, who, in the eighth year of his reign, took him captive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He carried off all the treasures of the temple
of the LORD and those of the palace, and broke up all the gold utensils that
Solomon, king of Israel, had provided in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD
had foretold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He deported all Jerusalem: all the officers and
men of the army, ten thousand in number, and all the craftsmen and smiths. None
were left among the people of the land except the poor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He deported Jehoiachin to Babylon, and also led
captive from Jerusalem to Babylon the king's mother and wives, his
functionaries, and the chief men of the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Babylon also led captive to Babylon
all seven thousand men of the army, and a thousand craftsmen and smiths, all of
them trained soldiers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In place of Jehoiachin, the king of Babylon
appointed his uncle Mattaniah king, and changed his name to Zedekiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he
became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also did evil in the sight of the LORD, just
as Jehoiakim had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD'S anger befell Jerusalem and Judah
till he cast them out from his presence. Thus Zedekiah rebelled against the
king of Babylon. </p>
