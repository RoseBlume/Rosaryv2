<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the day arrived on which the order decreed
by the king was to be carried out, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
Adar, on which the enemies of the Jews had expected to become masters of them,
the situation was reversed: the Jews became masters of their enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews mustered in their cities throughout
the provinces of King Ahasuerus to attack those who sought to do them harm, and
no one could withstand them, but all peoples were seized with a fear of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, all the officials of the provinces,
the satraps, governors, and royal procurators supported the Jews from fear of
Mordecai; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for Mordecai was powerful in the royal palace,
and the report was spreading through all the provinces that he was continually
growing in power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews struck down all their enemies with the
sword, killing and destroying them; they did to their enemies as they pleased. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the stronghold of Susa, the Jews killed and
destroyed five hundred men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon,
Aspatha, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Porathai, Adalia, Aridatha, 9 Parmashta,
Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-118 href="__PDK.HTM#$118">1</a></sup></font></sup> the ten sons of Haman, son of Hammedatha, the
foe of the Jews. However, they did not engage in plundering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the same day, when the number of those
killed in the stronghold of Susa was reported to the king, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to Queen Esther: &quot;In the stronghold
of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men, as well as the ten
sons of Haman. What must they have done in the other royal provinces! You shall
again be granted whatever you ask, and whatever you request shall be
honored.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Esther said, &quot;If it pleases your
majesty, let the Jews in Susa be permitted again tomorrow to act according to
today's decree, and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on gibbets.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then gave an order to this effect, and
the decree was published in Susa. So the ten sons of Haman were hanged, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-119 href="__PDK.HTM#$119">2</a></sup></font></sup> and the Jews in Susa mustered again on the
fourteenth of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa. However,
they did not engage in plundering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11A href="__PDK.HTM#$11A">3</a></sup></font></sup> The other Jews, who dwelt in the royal
provinces, also mustered and defended themselves, and obtained rest from their
enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of their foes, without engaging in
plunder, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On
the fourteenth of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and
rejoicing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The Jews in Susa, however, mustered on the thirteenth
and fourteenth of the month. But on the fifteenth they rested, and made it a
day of feasting and rejoicing.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That is why the rural Jews, who dwell in
villages, celebrate the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of rejoicing
and feasting, a holiday on which they send gifts of food to one another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters
to all the Jews, both near and far, in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He ordered them to celebrate every year both
the fourteenth and the fifteenth of the month of Adar </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as the days on which the Jews obtained rest
from their enemies and as the month which was turned for them from sorrow into
joy, from mourning into festivity. They were to observe these days with
feasting and gladness, sending food to one another and gifts to the poor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews took upon themselves for the future
this observance which they instituted at the written direction of Mordecai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the foe
of all the Jews, had planned to destroy them and had cast the pur, or lot, for
the time of their defeat and destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet, when Esther entered the royal presence,
the king ordered in writing that the wicked plan Haman had devised against the
Jews should instead be turned against Haman and that he and his sons should be
hanged on gibbets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And so these days have been named Purim after the
word pur. Thus, because of all that was contained in this letter, and because
of what they had witnessed and experienced in this affair, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Jews established and took upon themselves,
their descendants, and all who should join them, the inviolable obligation of
celebrating these two days every year in the manner prescribed by this letter,
and at the time appointed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These days were to be commemorated and kept in
every generation, by every clan, in every province, and in every city. These
days of Purim were never to fall into disuse among the Jews, nor into oblivion
among their descendants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-11B href="__PDK.HTM#$11B">4</a></sup></font></sup> Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail and of
Mordecai the Jew, wrote to confirm with full authority this second letter about
Purim, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when Mordecai sent documents concerning peace
