<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S0 href="__P8O.HTM#$S0">1</a></sup></font></sup> The queen of Sheba, having heard of Solomon's
fame, came to test him with subtle questions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She arrived in Jerusalem with a very numerous
retinue, and with camels bearing spices, a large amount of gold, and precious
stones. She came to Solomon and questioned him on every subject in which she
was interested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon explained everything she asked about,
and there remained nothing hidden from him that he could not explain to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the queen of Sheba witnessed Solomon's
great wisdom, the palace he had built, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the food at his table, the seating of his
ministers, the attendance and garb of his waiters, his banquet service, and the
holocausts he offered in the temple of the LORD, she was breathless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The report I heard in my country about
your deeds and your wisdom is true,&quot; she told the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Though I did not believe the report until
I came and saw with my own eyes, I have discovered that they were not telling
me the half. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report I heard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Happy are your men, happy these servants of
yours, who stand before you always and listen to your wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Blessed be the LORD, your God, whom it has
pleased to place you on the throne of Israel. In his enduring love for Israel,
the LORD has made you king to carry out judgment and justice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty
gold talents, a very large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again
did anyone bring such an abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King
Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S1 href="__P8O.HTM#$S1">2</a></sup></font></sup> Hiram's fleet, which used to bring gold from
Ophir, also brought from there a large quantity of cabinet wood and precious
stones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With the wood the king made supports for the
temple of the LORD and for the palace of the king, and harps and lyres for the
chanters. No more such wood was brought or seen to the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything
she desired and asked for, besides such presents as were given her from
Solomon's royal bounty. Then she returned with her servants to her own country.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The gold that Solomon received every year
weighed six hundred and sixty-six gold talents, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in addition to what came from the Tarshish
fleet, from the traffic of merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and the
governors of the country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, King Solomon made two hundred shields
of beaten gold (six hundred gold shekels went into each shield) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and three hundred bucklers of beaten gold
(three minas of gold went into each buckler); and he put them in the hall of
the Forest of Lebanon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king also had a large ivory throne made, and
overlaid it with refined gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The throne had six steps, a back with a round
top, and an arm on each side of the seat. Next to each arm stood a lion; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and twelve other lions stood on the steps, two
to a step, one on either side of each step. Nothing like this was produced in
any other kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In addition, all King Solomon's drinking
vessels were of gold, and all the utensils in the hall of the Forest of Lebanon
were of pure gold. There was no silver, for in Solomon's time it was considered
worthless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S2 href="__P8O.HTM#$S2">3</a></sup></font></sup> The king had a fleet of Tarshish ships at sea
with Hiram's fleet. Once every three years the fleet of Tarshish ships would
come with a cargo of gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus King Solomon surpassed in riches and
wisdom all the kings of the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the whole world sought audience with
Solomon, to hear from him the wisdom which God had put in his heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each one brought his yearly tribute: silver or
gold articles, garments, weapons, spices, horses and mules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon collected chariots and drivers; he had
one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand drivers; these he
allocated among the chariot cities and to the king's service in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as
stones, and cedars as numerous as the sycamores of the foothills. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon's horses were imported from Cilicia,
where the king's agents purchased them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A chariot imported from Egypt cost six hundred
shekels, a horse one hundred and fifty shekels; they were exported at these
rates to all the Hittite and Aramean kings. </p>
