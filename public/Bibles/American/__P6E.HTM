<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a chieftain, the Gileadite Jephthah,
born to Gilead of a harlot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gilead's wife had also borne him sons, and on
growing up the sons of the wife had driven Jephthah away, saying to him,
&quot;You shall inherit nothing in our family, for you are the son of another
woman.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jephthah had fled from his brothers and had
taken up residence in the land of Tob. A rabble had joined company with him,
and went out with him on raids. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some time later, the Ammonites warred on
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this occurred the elders of Gilead went to
bring Jephthah from the land of Tob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Come,&quot; they said to Jephthah,
&quot;be our commander that we may be able to fight the Ammonites.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Are you not the ones who hated me and
drove me from my father's house?&quot; Jephthah replied to the elders of
Gilead. &quot;Why do you come to me now, when you are in distress?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, &quot;In
any case, we have now come back to you; if you go with us to fight against the
Ammonites, you shall be the leader of all of us who dwell in Gilead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jephthah answered the elders of Gilead,
&quot;If you bring me back to fight against the Ammonites and the LORD delivers
them up to me, I shall be your leader.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah,
&quot;The LORD is witness between us that we will do as you say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and
the people made him their leader and commander. In Mizpah, Jephthah settled all
his affairs before the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he sent messengers to the king of the
Ammonites to say, &quot;What have you against me that you come to fight with me
in my land?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He answered the messengers of Jephthah,
&quot;Israel took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the Jordan when
they came up from Egypt. Now restore the same peaceably.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again Jephthah sent messengers to the king of
the Ammonites, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying to him, &quot;This is what Jephthah
says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For when they came up from Egypt, Israel went
through the desert to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom
saying, 'Let me pass through your land.' But the king of Edom did not give
consent. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he too was unwilling. So
Israel remained in Kadesh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they went through the desert, and
by-passing the land of Edom and the land of Moab, went east of the land of Moab
and encamped across the Arnon. Thus they did not go through the territory of
Moab, for the Arnon is the boundary of Moab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of
the Amorites, king of Heshbon. Israel said to him, 'Let me pass through your
land to my own place.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Sihon refused to let Israel pass through
his territory. On the contrary, he gathered all his soldiers, who encamped at
Jahaz and fought Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the LORD, the God of Israel, delivered
Sihon and all his men into the power of Israel, who defeated them and occupied
all the land of the Amorites dwelling in that region, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the whole territory from the Arnon to the
Jabbok, from the desert to the Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If now the LORD, the God of Israel, has cleared
the Amorites out of the way of his people, are you to dislodge Israel? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N7 href="__P6E.HTM#$N7">1</a></sup></font></sup> Should you not possess that which your god
Chemosh gave you to possess, and should we not possess all that the LORD, our
God, has cleared out for us? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again, are you any better than Balak, son of
Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel, or did he war against
them </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when Israel occupied Heshbon and its villages,
Aroer and its villages, and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon? Three
hundred years have passed; why did you not recover them during that time? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have not sinned against you, but you wrong me
by warring against me. Let the LORD, who is judge, decide this day between the
Israelites and the Ammonites!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed to
the message Jephthah sent him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah. He
passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and through Mizpah-Gilead as well, and from
there he went on to the Ammonites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N8 href="__P6E.HTM#$N8">2</a></sup></font></sup> Jephthah made a vow to the LORD. &quot;If you
deliver the Ammonites into my power,&quot; he said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;whoever comes out of the doors of my
house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites shall belong to
the LORD. I shall offer him up as a holocaust.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jephthah then went on to the Ammonites to fight
against them, and the LORD delivered them into his power, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so that he inflicted a severe defeat on them,
from Aroer to the approach of Minnith (twenty cities in all) and as far as
Abel-keramin. Thus were the Ammonites brought into subjection by the
Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jephthah returned to his house in Mizpah,
it was his daughter who came forth, playing the tambourines and dancing. She
was an only child: he had neither son nor daughter besides her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he saw her, he rent his garments and said,
&quot;Alas, daughter, you have struck me down and brought calamity upon me. For
I have made a vow to the LORD and I cannot retract.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Father,&quot; she replied, &quot;you have
made a vow to the LORD. Do with me as you have vowed, because the LORD has
wrought vengeance for you on your enemies the Ammonites.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N9 href="__P6E.HTM#$N9">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then she said to her father, &quot;Let me have
this favor. Spare me for two months, that I may go off down the mountains to
mourn my virginity with my companions.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go,&quot; he replied, and sent her away
for two months. So she departed with her companions and mourned her virginity
on the mountains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the end of the two months she returned to
her father, who did to her as he had vowed. She had not been intimate with man.
It then became a custom in Israel </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for Israelite women to go yearly to mourn the
daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days of the year. </p>

is probably due to an ancient copyist. Jephthah argues from the viewpoint of
his adversaries, the Ammonites, that they were entitled to all the land they
had conquered with the aid of their god. It does not necessarily follow that
Jephthah himself believed in the actual existence of this pagan god. </p>
