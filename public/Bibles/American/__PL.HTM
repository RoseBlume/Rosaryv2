<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The two angels reached Sodom in the evening, as
Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up to greet
them; and bowing down with his face to the ground, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2Q href="__PL.HTM#$2Q">1</a></sup></font></sup> he said, &quot;Please, gentlemen, come aside
into your servant's house for the night, and bathe your feet; you can get up
early to continue your journey.&quot; But they replied, &quot;No, we shall pass
the night in the town square.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He urged them so strongly, however, that they
turned aside to his place and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them,
baking cakes without leaven, and they dined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Before they went to bed, all the townsmen of
Sodom, both young and old - all the people to the last man - closed in on the
house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They called to Lot and said to him, &quot;Where
are the men who came to your house tonight? Bring them out to us that we may
have intimacies with them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Lot went out to meet them at the entrance. When
he had shut the door behind him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, &quot;I beg you, my brothers, not to
do this wicked thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have two daughters who have never had
intercourse with men. Let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as
you please. But don't do anything to these men, for you know they have come under
the shelter of my roof.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They replied, &quot;Stand back! This
fellow,&quot; they sneered, &quot;came here as an immigrant, and now he dares
to give orders! We'll treat you worse than them!&quot; With that, they pressed
hard against Lot, moving in closer to break down the door. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his guests put out their hands, pulled Lot
inside with them, and closed the door; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2R href="__PL.HTM#$2R">2</a></sup></font></sup> at the same time they struck the men at the
entrance of the house, one and all, with such a blinding light that they were
utterly unable to reach the doorway. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2S href="__PL.HTM#$2S">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then the angels said to Lot: &quot;Who else
belongs to you here? Your sons (sons-in-law) and your daughters and all who
belong to you in the city - take them away from it! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We are about to destroy this place, for the
outcry reaching the LORD against those in the city is so great that he has sent
us to destroy it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2T href="__PL.HTM#$2T">4</a></sup></font></sup> So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law,
who had contracted marriage with his daughters. &quot;Get up and leave this
place,&quot; he told them; &quot;the LORD is about to destroy the city.&quot;
But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As dawn was breaking, the angels urged Lot on,
saying, &quot;On your way! Take with you your wife and your two daughters who
are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he hesitated, the men, by the LORD'S
mercy, seized his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters and led
them to safety outside the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as they had been brought outside, he
was told: &quot;Flee for your life! Don't look back or stop anywhere on the
Plain. Get off to the hills at once, or you will be swept away.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Oh, no, my lord!&quot; replied Lot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have already thought enough of your
servant to do me the great kindness of intervening to save my life. But I
cannot flee to the hills to keep the disaster from overtaking me, and so I
shall die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2U href="__PL.HTM#$2U">5</a></sup></font></sup> Look, this town ahead is near enough to escape
to. It's only a small place. Let me flee there - it's a small place, isn't it?
- that my life may be saved.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Well, then,&quot; he replied, &quot;I
will also grant you the favor you now ask. I will not overthrow the town you
speak of. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hurry, escape there! I cannot do anything until
you arrive there.&quot; That is why the town is called Zoar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sun was just rising over the earth as Lot
arrived in Zoar; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>at the same time the LORD rained down
sulphurous fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah (from the LORD out of heaven). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2V href="__PL.HTM#$2V">6</a></sup></font></sup> He overthrew those cities and the whole Plain,
together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Lot's wife looked back, and she was turned
into a pillar of salt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning Abraham went to the place
where he had stood in the LORD'S presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2W href="__PL.HTM#$2W">7</a></sup></font></sup> As he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah
and the whole region of the Plain, he saw dense smoke over the land rising like
fumes from a furnace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus it came to pass: when God destroyed the
Cities of the Plain, he was mindful of Abraham by sending Lot away from the
upheaval by which God overthrew the cities where Lot had been living. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2X href="__PL.HTM#$2X">8</a></sup></font></sup> Since Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar, he and
his two daughters went up from Zoar and settled in the hill country, where he
lived with his two daughters in a cave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The older one said to the younger: &quot;Our
father is getting old, and there is not a man on earth to unite with us as was
the custom everywhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come, let us ply our father with wine and then
lie with him, that we may have offspring by our father.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So that night they plied their father with
wine, and the older one went in and lay with her father; but he was not aware
of her lying down or her getting up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
Next day the older one said to the younger: &quot;Last night it was I who lay
with my father. Let us ply him with wine again tonight, and then you go in and
lie with him, that we may both have offspring by our father.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So that night, too, they plied their father
with wine, and then the younger one went in and lay with him; but again he was
not aware of her lying down or her getting up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
Thus both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2Y href="__PL.HTM#$2Y">9</a></sup></font></sup> The older one gave birth to a son whom she
named Moab, saying, &quot;From my father.&quot; He is the ancestor of the
Moabites of today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
<sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2Z href="__PL.HTM#$2Z">10</a></sup></font></sup> The younger one, too, gave birth to a son, and she named

Ammonites of today. </p>

ceremony), or even whether the daughters involved were the same as, or

especially in a region containing bitumen (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PG.HTM#PENT.GEN.14.10"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
