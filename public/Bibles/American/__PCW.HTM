<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The following day Holofernes ordered his whole
army, and all the allied troops that had come to his support, to move against
Bethulia, seize the mountain passes, and engage the Israelites in battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That same day all their fighting men went into
action. Their forces numbered a hundred and seventy thousand infantry and
twelve thousand horsemen, not counting the baggage train or the men who
accompanied it on foot - a very great army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They encamped at the spring in the valley near
Bethulia, and spread out in breadth toward Dothan as far as Balbaim, and in
length from Bethulia to Cyamon, which faces Esdraelon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Israelites saw how many there were,
they said to one another in great dismay: &quot;Soon they will devour the whole
country. Neither the high mountains nor the valleys and hills can support the
mass of them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-109 href="__PCW.HTM#$109">1</a></sup></font></sup> Yet they all seized their weapons, lighted
fires on their bastions, and kept watch throughout the night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the second day Holofernes led out all his
cavalry in the sight of the Israelites who were in Bethulia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He reconnoitered the approaches to their city
and located their sources of water; these he seized, stationing armed
detachments around them, while he himself returned to his troops. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the commanders of the Edomites and all the
leaders of the Ammonites, together with the generals of the seacoast, came to
Holofernes and said: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Sir, listen to what we have to say, that
there may be no losses among your troops. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These Israelites do not rely on their spears,
but on the height of the mountains where they dwell; it is not easy to reach
the summit of their mountains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, sir, do not attack them in regular
formation; thus not a single one of your troops will fall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Stay in your camp, and spare all your soldiers.
Have some of your servants keep control of the source of water that flows out
at the base of the mountain, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for that is where the inhabitants of Bethulia
get their water. Then thirst will begin to carry them off, and they will
surrender their city. Meanwhile, we and our men will go up to the summits of
the nearby mountains, and encamp there to guard against anyone's leaving the
city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They and their wives and children will languish
with hunger, and even before the sword strikes them they will be laid low in
the streets of their city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus you will render them dire punishment for
their rebellion and their refusal to meet you peacefully.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their words pleased Holofernes and all his
ministers, and he ordered their proposal to be carried out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon the Moabites moved camp, together
with five thousand Assyrians. They encamped in the valley, and held the water
supply and the springs of the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Edomites and the Ammonites went up and
encamped in the mountain region opposite Dothan; and they sent some of their
men to the south and to the east opposite Egrebel, near Chusi, which is on Wadi
Mochmur. The rest of the Assyrian army was encamped in the plain, covering the
whole countryside. Their enormous store of tents and equipment was spread out
in profusion everywhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites cried to the Lord, their God,
for they were disheartened, since all their enemies had them surrounded, and
there was no way of slipping through their lines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The whole Assyrian camp, infantry, chariots,
and cavalry, kept them thus surrounded for thirty-four days. All the reservoirs
of water failed the inhabitants of Bethulia, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the cisterns ran dry, so that on no day did
they have enough to drink, but their drinking water was rationed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their children fainted away, and the women and
youths were consumed with thirst and were collapsing in the streets and
gateways of the city, with no strength left in them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people, therefore, including youths,
women, and children, went in a crowd to Uzziah and the rulers of the city. They
set up a great clamor and said before the elders: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;God judge between you and us! You have
done us grave injustice in not making peace with the Assyrians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There is no help for us now! Instead, God has
sold us into their power by laying us prostrate before them in thirst and utter
exhaustion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, summon them and deliver the whole
city as booty to the troops of Holofernes and to all his forces; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>we would be better off to become their prey. We
should indeed be made slaves, but at least we should live, and not have to
behold our little ones dying before our eyes and our wives and children
breathing out their souls. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We adjure you by heaven and earth, and by our
God, the Lord of our forefathers, who is punishing us for our sins and those of
our forefathers, to do as we have proposed, this very day.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All in the assembly with one accord broke into
shrill wailing and loud cries to the Lord their God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Uzziah said to them, &quot;Courage, my
brothers! Let us wait five days more for the Lord our God, to show his mercy
toward us; he will not utterly forsake us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if those days pass without help coming to
us, I will do as you say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he dispersed the men to their posts, and
they returned to the walls and towers of the city; the women and children he
sent to their homes. Throughout the city they were in great misery. </p>
