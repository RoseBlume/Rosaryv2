<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 19</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul discussed his intention of killing David
with his son Jonathan and with all his servants. But Saul's son Jonathan, who
was very fond of David, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>told him: &quot;My father Saul is trying to
kill you. Therefore, please be on your guard tomorrow morning; get out of sight
and remain in hiding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I, however, will go out and stand beside my
father in the countryside where you are, and will speak to him about you. If I
learn anything, I will let you know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan then spoke well of David to his father
Saul, saying to him: &quot;Let not your majesty sin against his servant David,
for he has committed no offense against you, but has helped you very much by
his deeds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he took his life in his hands and slew the
Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel through
him, you were glad to see it. Why, then, should you become guilty of shedding
innocent blood by killing David without cause?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul heeded Jonathan's plea and swore, &quot;As
the LORD lives, he shall not be killed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jonathan summoned David and repeated the
whole conversation to him. Jonathan then brought David to Saul, and David
served him as before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When war broke out again, David went out to
fight against the Philistines and inflicted a great defeat upon them, putting
them to flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon
Saul as he was sitting in his house with spear in hand and David was playing
the harp nearby. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul tried to nail David to the wall with the
spear, but David eluded Saul, so that the spear struck only the wall, and David
got away safe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q1 href="__P7D.HTM#$Q1">1</a></sup></font></sup> The same night, Saul sent messengers to
David's house to guard it, that he might kill him in the morning. David's wife
Michal informed him, &quot;Unless you save yourself tonight, tomorrow you will
be killed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Michal let David down through a window,
and he made his escape in safety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Michal took the household idol and laid it in
the bed, putting a net of goat's hair at its head and covering it with a
spread. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Saul sent messengers to arrest David, she
said, &quot;He is sick.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul, however, sent the messengers back to see
David and commanded them, &quot;Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill
him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the messengers entered, they found the
household idol in the bed, with the net of goat's hair at its head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul therefore asked Michal: &quot;Why did you
play this trick on me? You have helped my enemy to get away!&quot; Michal
answered Saul: &quot;He threatened me, 'Let me go or I will kill you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus David got safely away; he went to Samuel
in Ramah, informing him of all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel
went to stay in the sheds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Saul was told that David was in the sheds
near Ramah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he sent messengers to arrest David. But when
they saw the band of prophets, presided over by Samuel, in a prophetic frenzy,
they too fell into the prophetic state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Informed of this, Saul sent other messengers,
who also fell into the prophetic state. For the third time Saul sent
messengers, but they too fell into the prophetic state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then went to Ramah himself. Arriving at
the cistern of the threshing floor on the bare hilltop, he inquired,
&quot;Where are Samuel and David?&quot;, and was told, &quot;At the sheds near
Ramah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he set out from the hilltop toward the
sheds, the spirit of God came upon him also, and he continued on in a prophetic
condition until he reached the spot. At the sheds near Ramah </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he, too, stripped himself of his garments and
he, too, remained in the prophetic state in the presence of Samuel; all that
day and night he lay naked. That is why they say, &quot;Is Saul also among the
prophets?&quot; </p>
