<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he brought me back to the outer gate of
the sanctuary, facing the east; but it was closed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to me: This gate is to remain closed;
it is not to be opened for anyone to enter by it; since the LORD, the God of
Israel, has entered by it, it shall remain closed. </p>

gate, and leave by the same way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he brought me by way of the north gate to
the facade of the temple, and when I looked I saw the glory of the LORD filling
the LORD'S temple, and I fell prone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to me: Son of man, pay strict
attention, look carefully, and listen intently to all that I will tell you
about the statutes and laws of the LORD'S temple; be attentive in regard to
those who are to be admitted to the temple and all those who are to be excluded
from the sanctuary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Say to that rebellious house, the house of
Israel: Thus says the Lord GOD: Enough of all these abominations of yours, O

both in heart and flesh, to my sanctuary to profane it when you offered me
food, fat, and blood; thus you have broken my covenant by all your
abominations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead of caring for the service of my temple,
you have appointed such as these to serve me in my sanctuary in your stead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: No foreigners,
uncircumcised in heart and in flesh, shall ever enter my sanctuary; none of the
foreigners who live among the Israelites. </p>

the people, and they shall stand before the people to minister for them. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because they used to minister for them before
their idols, and became an occasion of sin to the house of Israel, therefore I
have sworn an oath against them, says the Lord GOD: they shall bear the
consequences of their sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall no longer draw near me to serve as
my priests, nor shall they touch any of my sacred things, or the most sacred
things. Thus they shall bear their disgrace because of all their abominable
deeds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I will set them to the service of the
temple, for all its work and for everything that is to be done in it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for the levitical priests, however, the
Zadokites who cared for my sanctuary when the Israelites strayed from me, they
shall draw near me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer
me fat and blood, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16

service. </p>

outer court, they shall take off the garments in which they ministered and
leave them in the chambers of the sanctuary, putting on other garments; thus
they will not transmit holiness to the people with their garments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall not shave their heads nor let their
hair hang loose, but they shall keep their hair carefully trimmed. </p>

widows or divorced women, but only virgins of the race of Israel; however, they
may marry women who are the widows of priests. </p>

between the clean and the unclean. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In capital cases they shall stand as judges,
judging them according to my decrees. They shall observe my laws and statutes
on all my festivals, and keep my sabbaths holy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall not make themselves unclean by
coming near any dead person, unless it be their father, mother, son, daughter,
brother, or maiden sister; for these they may make themselves unclean. </p>

GOD. </p>

Levites to menial service in the temple was enforced in the actual restoration
after the exile, and explains why relatively few Levites were willing to
return; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PBT.HTM#HIS.EZR.8.15"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Ezra 8:15-17.</p>
