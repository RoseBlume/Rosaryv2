departure of the Israelites from Egypt by night. It began at sundown after the
Passover lamb was sacrificed in the temple in the afternoon of the fourteenth
day of the month of Nisan. With the Passover supper on the same evening was
associated the eating of unleavened bread. The latter was continued through
Nisan 21, a reminder of the affliction of the Israelites and of the haste
surrounding their departure. Praise and thanks to God for his goodness in the
past were combined at this dual festival with the hope of future salvation. The
chief priests . . . to death: the intent to put Jesus to death was plotted for
a long time but delayed for fear of the crowd (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW5.HTM#GOSP.MAR.3.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark

Olives, a few miles from Jerusalem, in the house of Simon the leper, Jesus
defends a woman's loving action of anointing his head with perfumed oil in view
of his impending death and burial as a criminal, in which case his body would
not be anointed. See further the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXK.HTM#GOSP.JOH.12.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
12:7. He assures the woman of the remembrance of her deed in the
worldwide preaching of the good news.</p>

Unleavened Bread . . . the Passover lamb: a less precise designation of the day
for sacrificing the Passover lamb as evidenced by some rabbinical literature.

intimacy. The word abba seems not to have been used in earlier or

I will but what you will: note the complete obedient surrender of the human
