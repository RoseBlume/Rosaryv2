<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Men from Ziph came to Saul in Gibeah, reporting
that David was hiding on the hill of Hachilah at the edge of the wasteland. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Saul went off down to the desert of Ziph
with three thousand picked men of Israel, to search for David in the desert of
Ziph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul camped beside the road on the hill of
Hachilah, at the edge of the wasteland. David, who was living in the desert,
saw that Saul had come into the desert after him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and sent out scouts, who confirmed Saul's
arrival. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David himself then went to the place where Saul
was encamped and examined the spot where Saul and Abner, son of Ner, the
general, had their sleeping quarters. Saul's were within the barricade, and all
his soldiers were camped around him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David asked Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai,
son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, &quot;Who will go down into the camp with
me to Saul?&quot; Abishai replied, &quot;I will.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David and Abishai went among Saul's soldiers
by night and found Saul lying asleep within the barricade, with his spear
thrust into the ground at his head and Abner and his men sleeping around him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abishai whispered to David: &quot;God has
delivered your enemy into your grasp this day. Let me nail him to the ground
with one thrust of the spear; I will not need a second thrust!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David said to Abishai, &quot;Do not harm
him, for who can lay hands on the LORD'S anointed and remain unpunished? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the LORD lives,&quot; David continued,
&quot;it must be the LORD himself who will strike him, whether the time comes
for him to die, or he goes out and perishes in battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the LORD forbid that I touch his anointed!
Now take the spear which is at his head and the water jug, and let us be on our
way.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David took the spear and the water jug from
their place at Saul's head, and they got away without anyone's seeing or
knowing or awakening. All remained asleep, because the LORD had put them into a
deep slumber. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Going across to an opposite slope, David stood
on a remote hilltop at a great distance from Abner, son of Ner, and the troops.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then shouted, &quot;Will you not answer,
Abner?&quot; And Abner answered, &quot;Who is it that calls me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to Abner: &quot;Are you not a man
whose like does not exist in Israel? Why, then, have you not guarded your lord
the king when one of his subjects went to kill the king, your lord? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is no creditable service you have
performed. As the LORD lives, you people deserve death because you have not
guarded your lord, the LORD'S anointed. Go, look: where are the king's spear
and the water jug that was at his head?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul recognized David's voice and asked,
&quot;Is that your voice, my son David?&quot; David answered, &quot;Yes, my
lord the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He continued: &quot;Why does my lord pursue his
servant? What have I done? What evil do I plan? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q8 href="__P7K.HTM#$Q8">1</a></sup></font></sup> Please, now, let my lord the king listen to
the words of his servant. If the LORD has incited you against me, let an
offering appease him; but if men, may they be cursed before the LORD, because
they have exiled me so that this day I have no share in the LORD'S inheritance,
but am told: 'Go serve other gods!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not let my blood flow to the ground far from
the presence of the LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single
flea as if he were hunting partridge in the mountains.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul said: &quot;I have done wrong. Come
back, my son David, I will not harm you again, because you have held my life
precious today. Indeed, I have been a fool and have made a serious
mistake.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David answered: &quot;Here is the king's
spear. Let an attendant come over to get it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD will reward each man for his justice
and faithfulness. Today, though the LORD delivered you into my grasp, I would
not harm the LORD'S anointed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As I valued your life highly today, so may the
LORD value my life highly and deliver me from all difficulties.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul said to David: &quot;Blessed are you,
my son David! You shall certainly succeed in whatever you undertake.&quot;
David went his way, and Saul returned to his home. </p>
