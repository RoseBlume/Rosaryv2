<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;These are the statutes and decrees which
you must be careful to observe in the land which the LORD, the God of your
fathers, has given you to occupy, as long as you live on its soil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Destroy without fail every place on the high
mountains, on the hills, and under every leafy tree where the nations you are
to dispossess worship their gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tear down their altars, smash their sacred
pillars, destroy by fire their sacred poles, and shatter the idols of their
gods, that you may stamp out the remembrance of them in any such place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;That is not how you are to worship the
LORD, your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead, you shall resort to the place which
the LORD, your God, chooses out of all your tribes and designates as his
dwelling </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and there you shall bring your holocausts and
sacrifices, your tithes and personal contributions, your votive and freewill
offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and flocks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There, too, before the LORD, your God, you and
your families shall eat and make merry over all your undertakings, because the
LORD, your God, has blessed you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall not do as we are now doing; here,
everyone does what seems right to himself, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>since you have not yet reached your resting
place, the heritage which the LORD, your God, will give you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But after you have crossed the Jordan and dwell
in the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you as a heritage, when he has
given you rest from all your enemies round about and you live there in
security, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>then to the place which the LORD, your God,
chooses as the dwelling place for his name you shall bring all the offerings I
command you: your holocausts and sacrifices, your tithes and personal
contributions, and every special offering you have vowed to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall make merry before the LORD, your God,
with your sons and daughters, your male and female slaves, as well as with the
Levite who belongs to your community but has no share of his own in your
heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take care not to offer up your holocausts in
any place you fancy, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but offer them up in the place which the LORD
chooses from among your tribes; there you shall make whatever offerings I
enjoin upon you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;However, in any of your communities you
may slaughter and eat to your heart's desire as much meat as the LORD, your
God, has blessed you with; and the unclean as well as the clean may eat it, as
they do the gazelle or the deer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only, you shall not partake of the blood, but
must pour it out on the ground like water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, you shall not, in your own
communities, partake of your tithe of grain or wine or oil, of the first-born
of your herd or flock, of any offering you have vowed, of your freewill
offerings, or of your personal contributions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These you must eat before the LORD, your God,
in the place he chooses, along with your son and daughter, your male and female
slave, and the Levite who belongs to your community; and there, before the
LORD, you shall make merry over all your undertakings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take care, also, that you do not neglect the
Levite as long as you live in the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-I1 href="__P4R.HTM#$I1">1</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;After the LORD, your God, has enlarged
your territory, as he promised you, when you wish meat for food, you may eat it
at will, to your heart's desire; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and if the place which the LORD, your God,
chooses for the abode of his name is too far, you may slaughter in the manner I
have told you any of your herd or flock that the LORD has given you, and eat it
to your heart's desire in your own community. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You may eat it as you would the gazelle or the
deer: the unclean and the clean eating it alike. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But make sure that you do not partake of the
blood; for blood is life, and you shall not consume this seat of life with the
flesh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not partake of the blood, therefore, but
pour it out on the ground like water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abstain from it, that you and your children
after you may prosper for doing what is right in the sight of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, any sacred gifts or votive offerings
that you may have, you shall bring with you to the place which the LORD
chooses, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and there you must offer both the flesh and the
blood of your holocausts on the altar of the LORD, your God; of your other
sacrifices the blood indeed must be poured out against the altar of the LORD,
your God, but their flesh may be eaten. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Be careful to heed all these commandments I
enjoin on you, that you and your descendants may always prosper for doing what
is good and right in the sight of the LORD, your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When the LORD, your God, removes the
nations from your way as you advance to dispossess them, be on your guard!
Otherwise, once they have been wiped out before you and you have replaced them
and are settled in their land, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you will be lured into following them. Do not
inquire regarding their gods, 'How did these nations worship their gods? I,
too, would do the same.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall not thus worship the LORD, your God,
because they offered to their gods every abomination that the LORD detests,
even burning their sons and daughters to their gods. </p>
