<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jacob learned that grain rations were
available in Egypt, he said to his sons: &quot;Why do you keep gaping at one
another? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I hear,&quot; he went on, &quot;that rations of
grain are available in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, that we may
stay alive rather than die of hunger.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy an
emergency supply of grain from Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was only Joseph's full brother Benjamin that
Jacob did not send with the rest, for he thought some disaster might befall
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus, since there was famine in the land of Canaan
also, the sons of Israel were among those who came to procure rations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was Joseph, as governor of the country, who
dispensed the rations to all the people. When Joseph's brothers came and knelt
down before him with their faces to the ground, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he recognized them as soon as he saw them. But
he concealed his own identity from them and spoke sternly to them. &quot;Where
do you come from?&quot; he asked them. They answered, &quot;From the land of
Canaan, to procure food.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joseph recognized his brothers, although
they did not recognize him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-64 href="__P18.HTM#$64">1</a></sup></font></sup> he was reminded of the dreams he had about
them. He said to them: &quot;You are spies. You have come to see the nakedness
of the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;No, my lord,&quot; they replied. &quot;On
the contrary, your servants have come to procure food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All of us are sons of the same man. We are
honest men; your servants have never been spies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he answered them: &quot;Not so! You have
come to see the nakedness of the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We your servants,&quot; they said,
&quot;were twelve brothers, sons of a certain man in Canaan; but the youngest
one is at present with our father, and the other one is gone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;It is just as I said,&quot; Joseph
persisted; &quot;you are spies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is how you shall be tested: unless your
youngest brother comes here, I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you shall not
leave here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So send one of your number to get your brother,
while the rest of you stay here under arrest. Thus shall your words be tested
for their truth; if they are untrue, as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With that, he locked them up in the guardhouse
for three days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the third day Joseph said to them: &quot;Do
this, and you shall live; for I am a God-fearing man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you have been honest, only one of your brothers
need be confined in this prison, while the rest of you may go and take home
provisions for your starving families. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you must come back to me with your youngest
brother. Your words will thus be verified, and you will not die.&quot; To this
they agreed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To one another, however, they said: &quot;Alas,
we are being punished because of our brother. We saw the anguish of his heart
when he pleaded with us, yet we paid no heed; that is why this anguish has now
come upon us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Didn't I tell you,&quot; broke in Reuben,
&quot;not to do wrong to the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now comes the
reckoning for his blood.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They did not know, of course, that Joseph
understood what they said, since he spoke with them through an interpreter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But turning away from them, he wept. When he
was able to speak to them again, he had Simeon taken from them and bound before
their eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joseph gave orders to have their
containers filled with grain, their money replaced in each one's sack, and
provisions given them for their journey. After this had been done for them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they loaded their donkeys with the rations and
departed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-65 href="__P18.HTM#$65">2</a></sup></font></sup> At the night encampment, when one of them
opened his bag to give his donkey some fodder, he was surprised to see his
money in the mouth of his bag. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;My money has been returned!&quot; he
cried out to his brothers. &quot;Here it is in my bag!&quot; At that their
hearts sank. Trembling, they asked one another, &quot;What is this that God has
done to us?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they got back to their father Jacob in the
land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The man who is lord of the country,&quot;
they said, &quot;spoke to us sternly and put us in custody as if we were spying
on the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But we said to him: 'We are honest men; we have
never been spies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were twelve of us brothers, sons of the
same father; but one is gone, and the youngest one is at present with our
father in the land of Canaan.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the man who is lord of the country said to
us: 'This is how I shall know if you are honest men: leave one of your brothers
with me, while the rest of you go home with rations for your starving families.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you come back to me with your youngest
brother, and I know that you are honest men and not spies, I will restore your
brother to you, and you may move about freely in the land.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they were emptying their sacks, there in
each one's sack was his moneybag! At the sight of their moneybags, they and
their father were dismayed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their father Jacob said to them: &quot;Must you
make me childless? Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone, and now you would take
away Benjamin! Why must such things always happen to me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Reuben told his father: &quot;Put him in my
care, and I will bring him back to you. You may kill my own two sons if I do
not return him to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jacob replied: &quot;My son shall not go
down with you. Now that his full brother is dead, he is the only one left. If
some disaster should befall him on the journey you must make, you would send my
white head down to the nether world in grief.&quot; </p>
