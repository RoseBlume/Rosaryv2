<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This word came to Jeremiah from the LORD while
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his armies and the earth's kingdoms
subject to him, as well as the other peoples, were all attacking Jerusalem and
all her cities: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go to
Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him: Thus says the LORD: I am handing this
city over to the king of Babylon; he will destroy it with fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Neither shall you escape his hand; rather you
will be captured and fall into his hands. You shall see the king of Babylon and
speak to him face to face. Then you shall be taken to Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you obey the word of the LORD, Zedekiah,
king of Judah, then, says the LORD to you, you shall not die by the sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall die in peace, and they will lament
you as their lord, and burn spices for your burial as they did for your
fathers, the kings who preceded you from the first; it is I who make this
promise, says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet Jeremiah told all these things to
Zedekiah, king of Judah, in Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EK href="__PQC.HTM#$2EK">1</a></sup></font></sup> while the armies of the king of Babylon were
attacking Jerusalem and the remaining cities of Judah, Lachish, and Azekah,
since these alone were left of the fortified cities of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EL href="__PQC.HTM#$2EL">2</a></sup></font></sup> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from
the LORD after King Zedekiah had made an agreement with all the people in
Jerusalem to issue an edict of emancipation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Everyone was to free his Hebrew slaves, male
and female, so that no one should hold a man of Judah, his brother, in slavery.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the princes and the others who entered the
agreement consented to set free their male and female servants, so that they
should be slaves no longer. But though they agreed and freed them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>afterward they took back their male and female
slaves whom they had set free and again forced them into service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then this word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: The day
I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the place where they
were slaves, I made this covenant with them: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Every seventh year each of you shall set free
his Hebrew brother who has sold himself to you; six years he shall serve you,
but then you shall let him go free. Your fathers, however, did not heed me or
obey me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Today you indeed repented and did what is right
in my eyes by proclaiming the emancipation of your brethren and making an
agreement before me in the house that is named after me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But then you changed your mind and profaned my
name by taking back your male and female slaves to whom you had given their
freedom; you forced them once more into slavery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, thus says the LORD: You did not obey
me by proclaiming your neighbors and kinsmen free. I now proclaim you free,
says the LORD, for the sword, famine, and pestilence. I will make you an object
of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EM href="__PQC.HTM#$2EM">3</a></sup></font></sup> The men who violated my covenant and did not
observe the terms of the agreement which they made before me, I will make like
the calf which they cut in two, between whose two parts they passed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The princes of Judah and of Jerusalem, the
courtiers, the priests, and the common people, who passed between the parts of
the calf, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will hand over, all of them, to their
enemies, to those who seek their lives: their corpses shall be food for the
birds of the air and the beasts of the field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zedekiah, too, king of Judah, and his princes,
I will hand over to their enemies, to those who seek their lives, to the
soldiers of the king of Babylon who have at present withdrawn from you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will give the command, says the LORD, and
bring them back to this city. They shall attack and capture it, and destroy it
with fire; the cities of Judah I will turn into a desert where no man dwells. </p>

towns to the southwest of Jerusalem which Nebuchadnezzar besieged to prevent
help coming to Jerusalem from Egypt. Between 1935 and 1938, archaeologists
found at Lachish several letters written on pottery fragments which date from
598 or 588 B.C., and which mention both Lachish and Azekah. </p>

Jerusalem was in progress, the citizens of Jerusalem made a covenant at
Zedekiah's instigation to free their brother Judeans who were in slavery.
Doubtless this was both to provide additional free defenders for the city and
to offer reparation for past violations of the law, according to which Hebrew
slaves were to serve no longer than six years (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4U.HTM#PENT.DEU.15.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut
15:12-15). But when the siege was temporarily lifted, probably
because of the help promised by Pharaoh Hophra (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PQF.HTM#PROPHB.JER.37.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Jeremiah
37:5), the inhabitants of Jerusalem broke the covenant and once more
pressed their brethren into slavery (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PQC.HTM#PROPHB.JER.34.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Jeremiah

inscriptions make clear, agreements were sometimes ratified by walking between
the divided pieces of animals while the contracting parties invoked on
themselves a fate similar to that of the slaughtered beast if they should fail to
keep their word. The agreement: that mentioned in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PQC.HTM#PROPHB.JER.34.10"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Jeremiah
