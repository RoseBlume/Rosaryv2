<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WO href="__PB4.HTM#$WO">1</a></sup></font></sup> After this the Moabites, the Ammonites, and
with them some Meunites came to fight against Jehoshaphat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The message was brought to Jehoshaphat: &quot;A
great multitude is coming against you from across the sea, from Edom; they are
already in Hazazon-tamar&quot; (which is En-gedi). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat was frightened, and he hastened to
consult the LORD. He proclaimed a fast for all Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Judah gathered to seek help from the LORD;
from every one of the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah
and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD before the new court, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he said: &quot;LORD, God of our fathers,
are you not the God in heaven, and do you not rule over all the kingdoms of the
nations? In your hand is power and might, and no one can withstand you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was it not you, our God, who drove out the
inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and gave it forever to the
descendants of Abraham, your friend? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They have dwelt in it and they built in it a
sanctuary to your honor, saying, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'When evil comes upon us, the sword of
judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before
you, for your name is in this house, and we will cry out to you in our
affliction, and you will hear and save!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now, see the Ammonites, Moabites, and those
of Mount Seir whom you did not allow Israel to invade when they came from the
land of Egypt, but instead they passed them by and did not destroy them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See how they are now repaying us by coming to
drive us out of the possession you have given us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>O our God, will you not pass judgment on them?
We are powerless before this vast multitude that comes against us. We are at a
loss what to do, hence our eyes are turned toward you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All Judah was standing before the LORD, with their
little ones, their wives, and their young sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel,
son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite of
the clan of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he said: &quot;Listen, all of Judah,
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat! The LORD says to you: 'Do not
fear or lose heart at the sight of this vast multitude, for the battle is not
yours but God's. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Go down against them tomorrow. You will see
them coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will come upon them at the end of
the wadi which opens on the wilderness of Jeruel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You will not have to fight in this encounter.
Take your places, stand firm, and see how the LORD will be with you to deliver
you, Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or lose heart. Tomorrow go out to meet
them, and the LORD will be with you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoshaphat knelt down with his face to
the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the
LORD in worship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Levites from among the Kohathites and Korahites
rose to sing the praises of the LORD, the God of Israel, in a resounding
chorus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the early morning they hastened out to the
wilderness of Tekoa. As they were going out, Jehoshaphat halted and said:
&quot;Listen to me, Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem! Trust in the LORD, your
God, and you will be found firm. Trust in his prophets and you will
succeed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WP href="__PB4.HTM#$WP">2</a></sup></font></sup> After consulting with the people, he appointed
some to sing to the LORD and some to praise the holy Appearance as it went
forth at the head of the army. They sang: &quot;Give thanks to the LORD, for
his mercy endures forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the moment they began their jubilant hymn,
the LORD laid an ambush against the Ammonites, Moabites, and those of Mount
Seir who were coming against Judah, so that they were vanquished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the Ammonites and Moabites set upon the
inhabitants of Mount Seir and completely exterminated them. And when they had
finished with the inhabitants of Seir, they began to destroy each other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Judah came to the watchtower of the desert
and looked toward the throng, they saw only corpses fallen on the ground, with
no survivors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat and his people came to take
plunder, and they found an abundance of cattle and personal property, garments
and precious vessels. They took so much that they were unable to carry it all;
they were three days taking the spoil, so great was it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WQ href="__PB4.HTM#$WQ">3</a></sup></font></sup> On the fourth day they held an assembly in the
Valley of Beracah - for there they blessed the LORD; therefore that place has
ever since been called the Valley of Beracah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem, with
Jehoshaphat at their head, turned back toward Jerusalem celebrating the joyful
victory the LORD had given them over their enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They came to Jerusalem, to the house of the
LORD, with harps, lyres and trumpets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms
of the surrounding lands when they heard how the LORD had fought against the
enemies of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereafter Jehoshaphat's kingdom enjoyed peace,
for his God gave him rest on every side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was
thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in
Jerusalem. His mother was named Azubah, daughter of Shilhi. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He followed the path of his father Asa
unswervingly, doing what was right in the LORD'S sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the high places were not removed, nor as yet
had the people fixed their hearts on the God of their fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and
last, can be found written in the chronicle of Jehu, son of Hanani, which is
inserted in the book of the kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied
himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, who did evil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He joined with him in building ships to sail to
Tarshish; the fleet was built at Ezion-geber. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Eliezer, son of Dodavahu from Mareshah,
prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, &quot;Because you have joined with
Ahaziah, the LORD will shatter your work.&quot; And the ships were wrecked and
were unable to sail to Tarshish. </p>
