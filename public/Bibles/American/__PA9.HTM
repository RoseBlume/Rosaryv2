<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 19</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Afterward Nahash, king of the Ammonites, died
and his son succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said, &quot;I will show kindness to
Hanun, the son of Nahash, for his father treated me with kindness.&quot;
Therefore he sent envoys to him to comfort him over the death of his father.
But when David's servants had entered the land of the Ammonites to comfort
Hanun, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Ammonite princes said to Hanun, &quot;Do
you think David is doing this - sending you these consolers - to honor your
father? Have not his servants rather come to you to explore the land, spying it
out for its overthrow?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Hanun seized David's servants and had
them shaved and their garments cut off half-way at the hips. Then he sent them
away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David was informed of what had happened to
his men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men had been greatly
disgraced. &quot;Remain at Jericho,&quot; the king told them, &quot;until your
beards have grown again; and then you may come back here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Ammonites realized that they had put
themselves in bad odor with David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand
talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram Naharaim, from
Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They hired thirty-two thousand chariots along
with the king of Maacah and his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. The
Ammonites also assembled from their cities and came out for war. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David heard of this, he sent Joab and his
whole army of warriors against them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Ammonites marched out and lined up for a
battle at the gate of the city, while the kings who had come to their help
remained apart in the open field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joab saw that there was a battle line both
in front of and behind him, he chose some of the best fighters among the
Israelites and set them in array against the Arameans; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the rest of the army, which he placed under the
command of his brother Abishai, then lined up to oppose the Ammonites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he said: &quot;If the Arameans prove too
strong for me, you must come to my help; and if the Ammonites prove too strong
for you, I will save you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hold steadfast and let us show ourselves
courageous for the sake of our people and the cities of our God; then may the
LORD do what seems best to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab therefore advanced with his men to engage
the Arameans in battle; but they fled before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had
fled, they also took to flight before his brother Abishai, and reentered the
city. Joab then returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seeing themselves vanquished by Israel, the
Arameans sent messengers to bring out the Arameans from the other side of the
River, with Shophach, the general of Hadadezer's army, at their head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this was reported to David, he gathered
all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, and met them. With the army of David
drawn up to fight the Arameans, they gave battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David
slew seven thousand of their chariot fighters and forty thousand of their foot
soldiers; he also killed Shophach, the general of the army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the vassals of Hadadezer saw themselves
vanquished by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. After
this, the Arameans refused to come to the aid of the Ammonites. </p>
