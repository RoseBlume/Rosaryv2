<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ME href="__PSQ.HTM#$2ME">1</a></sup></font></sup> King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for a
thousand of his lords, with whom he drank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MF href="__PSQ.HTM#$2MF">2</a></sup></font></sup> Under the influence of the wine, he ordered
the gold and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar, his father, had taken from
the temple in Jerusalem, to be brought in so that the king, his lords, his wives
and his entertainers might drink from them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the gold and silver vessels taken from the
house of God in Jerusalem had been brought in, and while the king, his lords,
his wives and his entertainers were drinking </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>wine from them, they praised their gods of gold
and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Suddenly, opposite the lampstand, the fingers
of a human hand appeared, writing on the plaster of the wall in the king's
palace. When the king saw the wrist and hand that wrote, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>his face blanched; his thoughts terrified him,
his hip joints shook, and his knees knocked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king shouted for the enchanters, Chaldeans,
and astrologers to be brought in. &quot;Whoever reads this writing and tells me
what it means,&quot; he said to the wise men of Babylon, &quot;shall be clothed
in purple, wear a golden collar about his neck, and be third in the government
of the kingdom.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But though all the king's wise men came in,
none of them could either read the writing or tell the king what it meant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King Belshazzar was greatly terrified; his
face went ashen, and his lords were thrown into confusion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the queen heard of the discussion between
the king and his lords, she entered the banquet hall and said, &quot;O king,
live forever! Be not troubled in mind, nor look so pale! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the
spirit of the holy God; during the lifetime of your father he was seen to have
brilliant knowledge and god-like wisdom. In fact, King Nebuchadnezzar, your
father, made him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and
astrologers, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because of the extraordinary mind possessed by
this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. He knew and understood how to
interpret dreams, explain enigmas, and solve difficulties. Now therefore,
summon Daniel to tell you what this means.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Daniel was brought into the presence of
the king. The king asked him, &quot;Are you the Daniel, the Jewish exile, whom
my father, the king, brought from Judah? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have heard that the spirit of God is in you,
that you possess brilliant knowledge and extraordinary wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, the wise men and enchanters were brought
in to me to read this writing and tell me its meaning, but they could not say
what the words meant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I have heard that you can interpret dreams
and solve difficulties; if you are able to read the writing and tell me what it
means, you shall be clothed in purple, wear a gold collar about your neck, and
be third in the government of the kingdom.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel answered the king: &quot;You may keep
your gifts, or give your presents to someone else; but the writing I will read
for you, O king, and tell you what it means. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Most High God gave your father
Nebuchadnezzar a great kingdom and glorious majesty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because he made him so great, the nations and
peoples of every language dreaded and feared him. Whomever he wished, he killed
or let live; whomever he wished, he exalted or humbled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when his heart became proud and his spirit
hardened by insolence, he was put down from his royal throne and deprived of
his glory; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he was cast out from among men and was made
insensate as a beast; he lived with wild asses, and ate grass like an ox; his
body was bathed with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God
rules over the kingdom of men and appoints over it whom he will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your
heart, though you knew all this; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you have rebelled against the Lord of heaven.
You had the vessels of his temple brought before you, so that you and your
nobles, your wives and your entertainers, might drink wine from them; and you
praised the gods of silver and gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, that
neither see nor hear nor have intelligence. But the God in whose hand is your
life breath and the whole course of your life, you did not glorify. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By him were the wrist and hand sent, and the
writing set down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MG href="__PSQ.HTM#$2MG">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;This is the writing that was inscribed:
MENE, TEKEL, and PERES. These words mean: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MH href="__PSQ.HTM#$2MH">4</a></sup></font></sup> MENE, God has numbered your kingdom and put an
end to it; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>TEKEL, you have been weighed on the scales and
found wanting; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>PERES, your kingdom has been divided and given
to the Medes and Persians.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then by order of Belshazzar they clothed Daniel
in purple, with a gold collar about his neck, and proclaimed him third in the
government of the kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The same night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king,
was slain: </p>

&quot;Nabonidus.&quot;</p>
