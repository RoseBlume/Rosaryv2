<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There followed a long war between the house of
Saul and that of David, in which David grew stronger, but the house of Saul
weaker. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sons were born to David in Hebron: his
first-born, Amnon, of Ahinoam from Jezreel; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of
Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom, son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai, king
of Geshur; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the fourth, Adonijah, son of Haggith; the
fifth, Shephatiah, son of Abital; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the sixth, Ithream, of David's wife Eglah.
These were born to David in Hebron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During the war between the house of Saul and
that of David, Abner was gaining power in the house of Saul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Saul had had a concubine, Rizpah, the
daughter of Aiah. And Ishbaal, son of Saul, said to Abner, &quot;Why have you
been intimate with my father's concubine?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Enraged at the words of Ishbaal, Abner said,
&quot;Am I a dog's head in Judah? At present I am doing a kindness to the house
of your father Saul, to his brothers and his friends, by keeping you out of
David's clutches; yet this day you charge me with a crime involving a woman! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May God do thus and so to Abner if I do not
carry out for David what the LORD swore to him -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that is, take away the kingdom from the house
of Saul and establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan
to Beersheba.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In his fear of Abner, Ishbaal was no longer
able to say a word to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Abner sent messengers to David in Telam,
where he was at the moment, to say, &quot;Make an agreement with me, and I will
aid you by bringing all Israel over to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He replied, &quot;Very well, I will make an
agreement with you. But one thing I require of you. You must not appear before
me unless you bring back Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to present
yourself to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the same time David sent messengers to
Ishbaal, son of Saul, to say, &quot;Give me my wife Michal, whom I espoused by
paying a hundred Philistine foreskins.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ishbaal sent for her and took her away from her
husband Paltiel, son of Laish, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who followed her weeping as far as Bahurim. But
Abner said to him, &quot;Go back!&quot; And he turned back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abner then said in discussion with the elders
of Israel: &quot;For a long time you have been seeking David as your king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now take action, for the LORD has said of
David, 'By my servant David I will save my people Israel from the grasp of the
Philistines and from the grasp of all their enemies.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abner also spoke personally to Benjamin, and
then went to make his own report to David in Hebron concerning all that would
be agreeable to Israel and to the whole house of Benjamin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Abner, accompanied by twenty men, came to
David in Hebron, David prepared a feast for Abner and for the men who were with
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Abner said to David, &quot;I will now go
to assemble all Israel for my lord the king, that they may make an agreement
with you; you will then be king over all whom you wish to rule.&quot; So David
bade Abner farewell, and he went away in peace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Just then David's servants and Joab were coming
in from an expedition, bringing much plunder with them. Abner, having been
dismissed by David, was no longer with him in Hebron but had gone his way in
peace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joab and the whole force he had with him
arrived, he was informed, &quot;Abner, son of Ner, came to David; he has been
sent on his way in peace.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Joab went to the king and said: &quot;What
have you done? Abner came to you. Why did you let him go peacefully on his way?
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Are you not aware that Abner came to deceive
you and to learn the ins and outs of all that you are doing?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab then left David, and without David's
knowledge sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the cistern of
Sirah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him
aside within the city gate as though to speak with him privately. There he
stabbed him in the abdomen, and he died in revenge for the killing of Joab's
brother Asahel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Later David heard of it and said: &quot;Before
the LORD; I and my kingdom are forever innocent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May the full responsibility for the death of
Abner, son of Ner, be laid to Joab and to all his family. May the men of Joab's
family never be without one suffering from a discharge, or a leper, or one
unmanly, one falling by the sword, or one in need of bread!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Joab and his brother Abishai had lain in wait
for Abner because he killed their brother Asahel in battle at Gibeon.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to Joab and to all the people
who were with him, &quot;Rend your garments, gird yourselves with sackcloth,
and mourn over Abner.&quot; King David himself followed the bier. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had buried Abner in Hebron, the king
wept aloud at the grave of Abner, and the people also wept. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the king sang this elegy over Abner:
&quot;Would Abner have died like a fool? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your hands were not bound with chains, nor your
feet placed in fetters; As men fall before the wicked, you fell.&quot; And all
the people continued to weep for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they went to console David with food while
it was still day. But David swore, &quot;May God do thus and so to me if I eat bread
or anything else before sunset.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people noted this with approval, just
as they were pleased with everything that the king did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So on that day all the people and all Israel
came to know that the king had no part in the killing of Abner, son of Ner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then said to his servants: &quot;You
must recognize that a great general has fallen today in Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Although I am the anointed king, I am weak this
day, and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too ruthless for me. May the LORD
requite the evildoer in accordance with his evil deed.&quot; </p>
