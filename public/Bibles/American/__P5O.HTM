<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that,
in the capture and destruction of Ai, Joshua had done to that city and its king
as he had done to Jericho and its king. He heard also that the inhabitants of
Gibeon had made their peace with Israel, remaining among them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and that there was great fear abroad, because
Gibeon was large enough for a royal city, larger even than the city of Ai, and
all its men were brave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, sent for
Hoham, king of Hebron, Piram, king of Jarmuth, Japhia, king of Lachish, and
Debir, king of Eglon, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to come to his aid for an attack on Gibeon,
since it had concluded peace with Joshua and the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L7 href="__P5O.HTM#$L7">1</a></sup></font></sup> The five Amorite kings, of Jerusalem, Hebron,
Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon, united all their forces and marched against Gibeon,
where they took up siege positions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon, the men of Gibeon sent an appeal to
Joshua in his camp at Gilgal: &quot;Do not abandon your servants. Come up here
quickly and save us. Help us, because all the Amorite kings of the mountain country
have joined forces against us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his
picked troops and the rest of his soldiers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the LORD said to Joshua, &quot;Do not
fear them, for I have delivered them into your power. Not one of them will be
able to withstand you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when Joshua made his surprise attack upon
them after an all-night march from Gilgal, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the LORD threw them into disorder before him.
The Israelites inflicted a great slaughter on them at Gibeon and pursued them
down the Beth-horon slope, harrassing them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L8 href="__P5O.HTM#$L8">2</a></sup></font></sup> While they fled before Israel along the descent
from Beth-horon, the LORD hurled great stones from the sky above them all the
way to Azekah, killing many. More died from these hailstones than the
Israelites slew with the sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On this day, when the LORD delivered up the Amorites
to the Israelites,<br>
Joshua prayed to the LORD,<br>
and said in the presence of Israel:<br>
Stand still, O sun, at Gibeon,<br>
O moon, in the valley of Aijalon! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L9 href="__P5O.HTM#$L9">3</a></sup></font></sup> And the sun stood still,<br>
and the moon stayed,<br>
while the nation took vengeance on its foes.<br>
Is this not recorded in the Book of Jashar? The sun halted in the middle of the
sky; not for a whole day did it resume its swift course. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Never before or since was there a day like
this, when the LORD obeyed the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Then Joshua and all Israel returned to the
camp at Gilgal.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the five kings who had fled, hid in a
cave at Makkedah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joshua was told that the five kings had
been discovered hiding in a cave at Makkedah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, &quot;Roll large stones to the mouth
of the cave and post men over it to guard them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But do not remain there yourselves. Pursue your
enemies, and harry them in the rear. Do not allow them to escape to their
cities, for the LORD, your God, has delivered them into your power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once Joshua and the Israelites had finally
inflicted the last blows in this very great slaughter, and the survivors had
escaped from them into the fortified cities, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>all the army returned safely to Joshua and the
camp at Makkedah, no man uttering a sound against the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua said, &quot;Open the mouth of the
cave and bring out those five kings to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Obediently, they brought out to him from the
cave the five kings, of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had done so, Joshua summoned all the
men of Israel and said to the commanders of the soldiers who had marched with
him, &quot;Come forward and put your feet on the necks of these kings.&quot;
They came forward and put their feet upon their necks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua said to them, &quot;Do not be
afraid or dismayed, be firm and steadfast. This is what the LORD will do to all
the enemies against whom you fight.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Joshua struck and killed them, and
hanged them on five trees, where they remained hanging until evening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At sunset they were removed from the trees at
the command of Joshua and cast into the cave where they had hidden; over the
mouth of the cave large stones were placed, which remain until this very day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Makkedah, too, Joshua captured and put to the
sword at that time. He fulfilled the doom on the city, on its king, and on
every person in it, leaving no survivors. Thus he did to the king of Makkedah
what he had done to the king of Jericho. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua then passed on with all Israel from
Makkedah to Libnah, which he attacked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Libnah also, with its king, the LORD delivered
into the power of Israel. He put it to the sword with every person there,
leaving no survivors. Thus he did to its king what he had done to the king of
Jericho. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua next passed on with all Israel from
Libnah to Lachish, where they set up a camp during the attack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD delivered Lachish into the power of
Israel, so that on the second day Joshua captured it and put it to the sword
with every person in it, just as he had done to Libnah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help
Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his people, leaving him no survivors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Lachish, Joshua passed on with all Israel
to Eglon; encamping near it, they attacked it </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and captured it the same day, putting it to the
sword. He fulfilled the doom that day on every person in it, just as he had
done at Lachish. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Eglon, Joshua went up with all Israel to
Hebron, which they attacked </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and captured. They put it to the sword with its
king, all its towns, and every person there, leaving no survivors, just as
Joshua had done to Eglon. He fulfilled the doom on it and on every person
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua and all Israel turned back to Debir
and attacked it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>capturing it with its king and all its towns.
They put them to the sword and fulfilled the doom on every person there,
leaving no survivors. Thus was done to Debir and its king what had been done to
Hebron, as well as to Libnah and its king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua conquered the entire country; the
mountain regions, the Negeb, the foothills, and the mountain slopes, with all
their kings. He left no survivors, but fulfilled the doom on all who lived
there, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-LA href="__P5O.HTM#$LA">4</a></sup></font></sup> Joshua conquered from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza,
and all the land of Goshen to Gibeon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All these kings and their lands Joshua captured
in a single campaign, for the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. </p>

21:14), recounted in epic style the exploits of Israel's early
heroes. The sun halted: though it is widely supposed that this passage
describes in popular language and according to external appearances a
miraculous lengthening of the day, it is equally probable that Joshua's prayer
was rather for an abrupt obscuration of the sun, which would impede his enemies
in their flight homeward and also prevent them from rallying their forces; this
request would have been answered by the hailstorm (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNC.HTM#WISDB.SIR.46.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach
46:5) and by a darkness relieved only twenty-four hours later, well
