<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 25</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Three days after his arrival in the province,
Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>where the chief priests and Jewish leaders
presented him their formal charges against Paul. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-459 href="__PYJ.HTM#$459">1</a></sup></font></sup> They
asked him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as a favor to have him sent to Jerusalem, for
they were plotting to kill him along the way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Festus replied that Paul was being held in
custody in Caesarea and that he himself would be returning there shortly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said, &quot;Let your authorities come down
with me, and if this man has done something improper, let them accuse
him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After spending no more than eight or ten days
with them, he went down to Caesarea, and on the following day took his seat on
the tribunal and ordered that Paul be brought in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he appeared, the Jews who had come down
from Jerusalem surrounded him and brought many serious charges against him,
which they were unable to prove. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In defending himself Paul said, &quot;I have committed
no crime either against the Jewish law or against the temple or against
Caesar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45A href="__PYJ.HTM#$45A">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then Festus, wishing to ingratiate himself
with the Jews, said to Paul in reply, &quot;Are you willing to go up to
Jerusalem and there stand trial before me on these charges?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul answered, &quot;I am standing before the
tribunal of Caesar; this is where I should be tried. I have committed no crime
against the Jews, as you very well know. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If I have committed a crime or done anything
deserving death, I do not seek to escape the death penalty; but if there is no
substance to the charges they are bringing against me, then no one has the
right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Festus, after conferring with his council,
replied, &quot;You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When a few days had passed, King Agrippa and
Bernice <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45B href="__PYJ.HTM#$45B">3</a></sup></font></sup> arrived in Caesarea on a visit to Festus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since they spent several days there, Festus
referred Paul's case to the king, saying, &quot;There is a man here left in
custody by Felix. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and
the elders of the Jews brought charges against him and demanded his
condemnation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I answered them that it was not Roman practice
to hand over an accused person before he has faced his accusers and had the
opportunity to defend himself against their charge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when (they) came together here, I made no
delay; the next day I took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be
brought in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His accusers stood around him, but did not
charge him with any of the crimes I suspected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead they had some issues with him about
their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died but who Paul claimed
was alive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since I was at a loss how to investigate this
controversy, I asked if he were willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand
trial on these charges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when Paul appealed that he be held in
custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him held until I could send him
to Caesar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Agrippa said to Festus, &quot;I too should like
to hear this man.&quot; He replied, &quot;Tomorrow you will hear him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with
great ceremony and entered the audience hall in the company of cohort
commanders and the prominent men of the city and, by command of Festus, Paul
was brought in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Festus said, &quot;King Agrippa and all you
here present with us, look at this man about whom the whole Jewish populace
petitioned me here and in Jerusalem, clamoring that he should live no longer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I found, however, that he had done nothing
deserving death, and so when he appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I have nothing definite to write about him
to our sovereign; therefore I have brought him before all of you, and
particularly before you, King Agrippa, so that I may have something to write as
a result of this investigation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For it seems senseless to me to send up a
prisoner without indicating the charges against him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

animosity toward Paul in Jerusalem had not subsided (see
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYI.HTM#GOSP.ACT.24.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 24:27). </p>

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYJ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.25.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 25:11). Paul uses his right as a Roman

60) (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYJ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.25.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 25:12). This move broke the deadlock
between Roman protective custody of Paul and the plan of his enemies to kill
him (3).</p>

Agrippa II was a petty ruler over small areas in northern Palestine and some
villages in Perea. His influence on the Jewish population of Palestine was
insignificant.</p>
