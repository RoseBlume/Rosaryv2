<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p>

<p>The person to
whom this letter is ascribed can scarcely be one of the two members of the
Twelve who bore the name James (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVJ.HTM#GOSP.MAT.10.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
10:2-3; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW5.HTM#GOSP.MAR.3.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 3:17-18;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWP.HTM#GOSP.LUK.6.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 6:14-15), for he is not identified as an
apostle but only as &quot;slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11V.HTM#CATHL.JAM.1.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> James 1:1). This designation most probably refers
to the third New Testament personage named James, a relative of Jesus who is
usually called &quot;brother of the Lord&quot; (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVM.HTM#GOSP.MAT.13.55"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
13:55; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW8.HTM#GOSP.MAR.6.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 6:3). He was the leader of
the Jewish Christian community in Jerusalem whom Paul acknowledged as one of
the &quot;pillars&quot; (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P102.HTM#NTLET.GAL.2.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal 2:9). In Acts he
appears as the authorized spokesman for the Jewish Christian position in the
early Church (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY6.HTM#GOSP.ACT.12.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 12:17;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY9.HTM#GOSP.ACT.15.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 15:13-21). According to the Jewish historian
Josephus (Antiquities 20, 9, 1 201-203), he was stoned to death by the Jews
under the high priest Ananus II in A.D. 62.</p>

<p>The letter is addressed to
&quot;the twelve tribes in the dispersion.&quot; In Old Testament terminology
the term &quot;twelve tribes&quot; designates the people of Israel; the
&quot;dispersion&quot; or &quot;diaspora&quot; refers to the non-Palestinian
Jews who had settled throughout the Greco-Roman world (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXF.HTM#GOSP.JOH.7.35"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John
7:35). Since in Christian thought the church is the new Israel, the
address probably designates the Jewish Christian churches located in Palestine,
Syria, and elsewhere. Or perhaps the letter is meant more generally for all
Christian communities, and the &quot;dispersion&quot; has the symbolic meaning
of exile from our true home, as it has in the address of 1 Peter
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P121.HTM#CATHL.1PET.1.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Peter 1:1). The letter is so markedly Jewish in
character that some scholars have regarded it as a Jewish document subsequently
&quot;baptized&quot; by a few Christian insertions, but such an origin is
scarcely tenable in view of the numerous contacts discernible between the
Letter of James and other New Testament literature.</p>

<p>From the viewpoint of its
literary form, James is a letter only in the most conventional sense; it has
none of the characteristic features of a real letter except the address. It
belongs rather to the genre of parenesis or exhortation and is concerned almost
exclusively with ethical conduct. It therefore falls within the tradition of
Jewish wisdom literature, such as can be found in the Old Testament (Proverbs,
Sirach) and in the extracanonical Jewish literature (Testaments of the Twelve
Patriarchs, the Books of Enoch, the Manual of Discipline found at Qumran). More
specifically, it consists of sequences of didactic proverbs, comparable to
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PCE.HTM#HIS.TOB.4.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Tobit 4:5-19, to many passages in Sirach, and to
sequences of sayings in the synoptic gospels. Numerous passages in James treat
of subjects that also appear in the synoptic sayings of Jesus, especially in
Matthew's Sermon on the Mount, but the correspondences are too general to
establish any literary dependence. James represents a type of early
Christianity that emphasized sound teaching and responsible moral behavior.
Ethical norms are derived not primarily from christology, as in Paul, but from
a concept of salvation that involves conversion, baptism, forgiveness of sin,
and expectation of judgment (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11V.HTM#CATHL.JAM.1.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> James 1:17;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Y.HTM#CATHL.JAM.4.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 4:12).</p>

<p>Paradoxically, this very
Jewish work is written in an excellent Greek style, which ranks among the best
in the New Testament and appears to be the work of a trained Hellenistic
writer. Those who continue to regard James of Jerusalem as its author are
therefore obliged to suppose that a secretary must have put the letter into its
present literary form. This assumption is not implausible in the light of
ancient practice. Some regard the letter as one of the earliest writings in the
New Testament and feel that its content accurately reflects what we would
expect of the leader of Jewish Christianity. Moreover, they argue that the type
of Jewish Christianity reflected in the letter cannot be situated historically
after the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</p>

<p>Others, however, believe it
more likely that James is a pseudonymous work of a later period. In addition to
its Greek style, they observe further that (a) the prestige that the writer is
assumed to enjoy points to the later legendary reputation of James; (b) the
discussion of the importance of good works seems to presuppose a debate
subsequent to that in Paul's own day; (c) the author does not rely upon
prescriptions of the Mosaic law, as we would expect from the historical James;
(d) the letter contains no allusions to James's own history and to his
relationship with Jesus or to the early Christian community of Jerusalem. For
these reasons, many recent interpreters assign James to the period A.D. 90-100.</p>

<p>The principal divisions of
the Letter of James are the following:</p>

<ol start=1 type=I>
 Address (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11V.HTM#CATHL.JAM.1.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> James
     1:1) 
 The Value of Trials and Temptation
     (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11V.HTM#CATHL.JAM.1.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> James 1:2-18) 
 Exhortations and Warnings
     (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11V.HTM#CATHL.JAM.1.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> James 1:19-<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Z.HTM#CATHL.JAM.5.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 5:12)
     
 The Power of Prayer
     (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Z.HTM#CATHL.JAM.5.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> James 5:13-20)
