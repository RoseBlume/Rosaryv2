<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They brought the boy to him. And when he saw
him, the spirit immediately threw the boy into convulsions. As he fell to the

us.&quot; </p>

Everything is possible to one who has faith.&quot; </p>

believe, help my unbelief!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25

come out of him and never enter him again!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions,

six days after the first prediction of his passion and death and his

9:28 has &quot;about eight days.&quot; Thus the transfiguration
counterbalances the prediction of the passion by affording certain of the

overcome his death and that of his disciples; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZP.HTM#NTLET.2COR.3.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Cor
