<p class=MsoNormal>The
New Testament of The New American Bible, a fresh translation from the Greek
text, was first published in complete form in 1970, together with the Old
Testament translation that had been completed the previous year. Portions of
the New Testament had appeared earlier, in somewhat different form, in the
provisional Mass lectionary of 1964 and in the Lectionary for Mass of 1970. </p>

<p>Since 1970 many different
printings of the New Testament have been issued by a number of publishers, both
separately and in complete bibles, and the text has become widely known both in
the United States and in other English-speaking countries. Most American
Catholics have been influenced by it because of its widespread use in the
liturgy, and it has received a generally favorable reception from many other
Christians as well. It has taken its place among the standard contemporary
translations of the New Testament, respected for its fidelity to the original
and its attempt to render this into current American English.</p>

<p>Although the scriptures
themselves are timeless, translations and explanations of them quickly become
dated in an era marked by rapid cultural change to a degree never previously
experienced. The explosion of biblical studies that has taken place in our
century and the changing nature of our language itself require periodic
adjustment both in translations and in the accompanying explanatory materials.
The experience of actual use of the New Testament of The New American Bible,
especially in oral proclamation, has provided a basis for further improvement.
Accordingly, it was decided in 1978 to proceed with a thorough revision of the
New Testament to reflect advances in scholarship and to satisfy needs
identified through pastoral experience.</p>

<p>For this purpose a steering
committee was formed to plan, organize, and direct the work of revision, to
engage collaborators, and to serve as an editoral board to coordinate the work
of the various revisers and to determine the final form of the text and the
explanatory materials. Guidelines were drawn up and collaborators selected in
1978 and early 1979, and November of 1980 was established as the deadline for
manuscripts. From December 1980 through September 1986 the editoral board met a
total of fifty times and carefully reviewed and revised all the material in
order to ensure accuracy and consistency of approach. The editors also worked
together with the bishops' ad hoc committee that was appointed by the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1982 to oversee the revision.</p>

<p>The threefold purpose of
the translation that was expressed in the preface to the first edition has been
maintained in the revision: to provide a version suitable for liturgical
proclamation, for private reading, and for purposes of study. Special attention
has been given to the first of these purposes, since oral proclamation demands
special qualities in a translation, and experience had provided insights and
suggestions that could lead to improvement in this area. Efforts have also been
made, however, to facilitate devotional reading by providing suitable notes and
introductory materials, and to assist the student by achieving greater accuracy
and consistency in the translation and supplying more abundant information in
the introductions and notes.</p>

<p>The primary aim of the
revision is to produce a version as accurate and faithful to the meaning of the
Greek original as is possible for a translation. The editors have consequently
moved in the direction of a formal-equivalence approach to translation,
matching the vocabulary, structure, and even word order of the original as
closely as possible in the receptor language. Some other contemporary biblical
versions have adopted, in varying degrees, a dynamic-equivalence approach,
which attempts to respect the individuality of each language by expressing the
meaning of the original in a linguistic structure suited to English, even
though this may be very different from the corresponding Greek structure. While
this approach often results in fresh and brilliant renderings, it has the
disadvantages of more or less radically abandoning traditional biblical and
liturgical terminology and phraseology, of expanding the text to include what
more properly belongs in notes, commentaries, or preaching, and of tending
toward paraphrase. A more formal approach seems better suited to the specific
purposes intended for this translation.</p>

<p>At the same time, the
editors have wished to produce a version in English that reflects contemporary
American usage and is readily understandable to ordinary educated people, but
one that will be recognized as dignified speech, on the level of formal rather
than colloquial usage. These aims are not in fact contradictory, for there are
different levels of language in current use: the language of formal situations
as not that of colloquial conversation, though people understand both and may
pass from one to the other without adverting to the transition. The liturgy is
a formal situation that requires a level of discourse more dignified, formal,
and hieratic than the world of business, sport, or informal communication.
People readily understand this more formal level even though they may not often
use it; our passive vocabulary is much larger than our active vocabulary. Hence
this revision, while avoiding archaisms, does not shrink from traditional
biblical terms that are easily understood even though not in common use in
everyday speech. The level of language consciously aimed at is one appropriate
for liturgical proclamation; this may also permit the translation to serve the
purposes of devotional reading and serious study.</p>

<p>A particular effort has
been made to insure consistency of vocabulary. Always to translate a given
Greek word by the same English equivalent would lead to ludicrous results and
to infidelity to the meaning of the text. But in passages where a particular
Greek term retains the same meaning, it has been rendered in the same way
insofar as this has been feasible; this is particularly significant in the case
of terms that have a specific theological meaning. The synoptic gospels have
been carefully translated so as to reveal both the similarities and the
differences of the Greek.</p>

<p>An especially sensitive
problem today is the question of discrimination in language. In recent years
there has been much discussion about allegations of anti-Jewish expressions in
the New Testament and of language that discriminates against various
minorities. Above all, however, the question of discrimination against women
affects the largest number of people and arouses the greatest degree of
interest and concern. At present there is little agreement about these problems
or about the best way to deal with them. In all these areas the present translation
attempts to display a sensitivity appropriate to the present state of the
questions under discussion, which are not yet resolved and in regard to which
it is impossible to please everyone, since intelligent and sincere participants
in the debate hold mutually contradictory views.</p>

<p>The primary concern in this
revision is fidelity to what the text says. When the meaning of the Greek is
inclusive of both sexes, the translation seeks to reproduce such inclusivity
insofar as this is possible in normal English usage, without resort to
inelegant circumlocutions or neologisms that would offend against the dignity
of the language. Although the generic sense of man is traditional in English,
many today reject it; its use has therefore generally been avoided, though it
is retained in cases where no fully satisfactory equivalent could be found.
English does not possess a gender-inclusive third personal pronoun in the
singular, and this translation continues to use the masculine resumptive
pronoun after everyone or anyone, in the traditional way, where this cannot be
avoided without infidelity to the meaning.</p>

<p>The translation of the
Greek word adelphos, particularly in the plural form adelphoi, poses an
especially delicate problem. While the term literally means brothers or other
male blood relatives, even in profane Greek the plural can designate two
persons, one of either sex, who were born of the same parents. It was adopted
by the early Christians to designate, in a figurative sense, the members of the
Christian community, who were conscious of a new familial relationship to one
another by reason of their adoption as children of God. They are consequently
addressed as adelphoi. This has traditionally been rendered into English by
brothers or, more archaically, brethren. There has never been any doubt that
this designation includes all the members of the Christian community, both male
and female. Given the absence in English of a corresponding term that
explicitly includes both sexes, this translation retains the usage of brothers,
with the inclusive meaning that has been traditionally attached to it in this
biblical context. Since the New Testament is the product of a particular time
and culture, the views expressed in it and the language in which they are
expressed reflect a particular cultural conditioning, which sometimes makes
them quite different from contemporary ideas and concerns. Discriminatory
language should be eliminated insofar as possible whenever it is unfaithful to
the meaning of the New Testament, but the text should not be altered in order
to adjust it to contemporary concerns. This translation does not introduce any
changes, expansions, additions to, or subtractions from the text of scripture.
It further retains the traditional biblical ways of speaking about God and
about Christ, including the use of masculine nouns and pronouns.</p>

<p>The Greek text followed in
this translation is that of the third edition of The Greek New Testament,
edited by Kurt Aland, Matthew Black, Carlo Martini, Bruce Metzger, and Allen
Wikgren, and published by the United Bible Societies in 1975. The same text,
with a different critical apparatus and variations in punctuation and
typography, was published as the twenty-sixth edition of the Nestle-Aland Novum
Testamentum Graece in 1979 by the Deutsche Bibelstiftung, Stuttgart. This
edition has also been consulted. When variant readings occur, the translation,
with few exceptions, follows the reading that was placed in the text of these
Greek editions, though the occurrence of the principal variants is pointed out
in the notes.</p>

<p>The editors of the Greek
text placed square brackets around words or portions of words of which the
authenticity is questionable because the evidence of textual witnesses is
inconclusive. The same has been done in the translation insofar as it is
possible to reproduce this convention in English. It should be possible to read
the text either with or without the disputed words, but in English it is not
always feasible to provide this alternative, and in some passages the bracketed
words must be included to make sense. As in the first edition, parentheses do
not indicate textual uncertainty, but are simply a punctuation device to
indicate a passage that in the editors' judgment appears parenthetical to the
thought of the author.</p>

<p>Citations from the Old
Testament are placed within quotation marks; longer citations are set off as
block quotations in a separate indented paragraph. The sources of such
citations, as well as those of many more or less subtle allusions to the Old Testament,
are identified in the biblical cross-reference section at the bottom of each
page. Insofar as possible, the translation of such Old Testament citations
agrees with that of The New American Bible Old Testament whenever the
underlying Greek agrees with the Hebrew (or, in some cases, the Aramaic or
Greek) text from which the Old Testament translation was made. But citations in
the New Testament frequently follow the Septuagint or some other version, or
were made from memory, hence, in many cases the translation in the New
Testament passage will not agree with what appears in the Old Testament. Some
of these cases are explained in the notes.</p>

<p>It is a further aim of the
revised edition to supply explanatory materials more abundantly than in the
first edition. In most cases the introductions and notes have been entirely
rewritten and expanded, and the cross-references checked and revised. It is
intended that these materials should reflect the present state of sound
biblical scholarship and should be presented in such a form that they can be
assimilated by the ordinary intelligent reader without specialized biblical
training. While they have been written with the ordinary educated Christian in
mind, not all technical vocabulary can be entirely dispensed with in
approaching the Bible, any more than in any other field. It is the hope of the
editors that these materials, even if they sometimes demand an effort, will
help the reader to a fuller and more intelligent understanding of the New
Testament and a fruitful appropriation of its meaning for personal spiritual
growth.</p>

<p style='margin-right:1.3pt'>The
New American Bible is a Roman Catholic translation. This revision, however,
like the first edition, has been accomplished with the collaboration of
scholars from other Christian churches, both among the revisers and on the
editorial board, in response to the encouragement of Vatican Council II (Dei
Verbum, 22). The editorial board expresses gratitude to all who have
collaborated in the revision: to all the revisers, consultants, and bishops who
contributed to it, to reviewers of the first edition, and to those who
voluntarily submitted suggestions. May this translation fulfill its threefold
purpose, &quot;so that the word of the Lord may speed forward and be
glorified&quot; (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P10X.HTM#NTLET.2THE.3.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Thes 3:1). - The Feast of St.
