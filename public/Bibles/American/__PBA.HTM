<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 26</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people of Judah chose Uzziah, though he
was but sixteen years of age, and proclaimed him king to succeed his father
Amaziah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah; this
was after King Amaziah had gone to rest with his ancestors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became
king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother, named Jecoliah,
was from Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He pleased the LORD, just as his father Amaziah
had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WY href="__PBA.HTM#$WY">1</a></sup></font></sup> He was prepared to seek God as long as
Zechariah lived, who taught him to fear God; and as long as he sought the LORD,
God made him prosper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went out and fought the Philistines and
razed the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod (and built cities in the district of
Ashdod and in Philistia). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God helped him against the Philistines, against
the Arabs who dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the Meunites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah and his
fame spread as far as Egypt, for he grew stronger and stronger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at
the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he fortified them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He built towers in the desert and dug numerous
cisterns, for he had many cattle. He had plowmen in the foothills and the
plains, and vinedressers in the highlands and the garden land. He was a lover
of the soil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Uzziah also had a standing army of fit soldiers
divided into bands according to the number in which they were mustered by Jeiel
the scribe and Maaseiah the recorder, under the command of Hananiah, one of the
king's officials. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The entire number of family heads over these
valiant warriors was two thousand six hundred, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and at their disposal was a mighty army of
three hundred seven thousand five hundred fighting men of great valor to help
the king against his enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Uzziah provided for them - for the entire army
- bucklers, lances, helmets, breastplates, bows and slingstones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also built machines in Jerusalem, devices
contrived to stand on the towers and at the angles of the walls to shoot arrows
and cast large stones. His fame spread far and wide, and his power was ascribed
to the marvelous help he had received. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But after he had become strong, he became proud
to his own destruction and broke faith with the LORD, his God. He entered the
temple of the LORD to make an offering on the altar of incense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Azariah the priest, and with him eighty
other priests of the LORD, courageous men, followed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They opposed King Uzziah, saying to him:
&quot;It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but for the
priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated for this purpose. Leave
the sanctuary, for you have broken faith and no longer have a part in the glory
that comes from the LORD God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Uzziah, who was holding a censer for burning
the incense, became angry, but at the moment he showed his anger to the
priests, while they were looking at him in the house of the LORD beside the
altar of incense, leprosy broke out on his forehead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Azariah the chief priest and all the other
priests examined him, and when they saw that his forehead was leprous, they
expelled him from the temple. He himself fled willingly, for the LORD had
afflicted him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Uzziah remained a leper to the day of his
death. As a leper he dwelt in a segregated house, for he was excluded from the
house of the LORD. Therefore his son Jotham was regent of the palace and ruled
the people of the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet Isaiah, son of Amos, wrote the rest
of the acts of Uzziah, first and last. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Uzziah rested with his ancestors; he was buried
with them in the field adjoining the royal cemetery, for they said, &quot;He
was a leper.&quot; His son Jotham succeeded him as king. </p>
