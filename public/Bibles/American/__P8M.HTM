<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the order of Solomon, the elders of Israel
and all the leaders of the tribes, the princes in the ancestral houses of the
Israelites, came to King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the
LORD'S covenant from the city of David (which is Zion). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the men of Israel assembled before King
Solomon during the festival in the month of Ethanim (the seventh month). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the
priests took up the ark; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they carried the ark of the LORD and the meeting
tent with all the sacred vessels that were in the tent. (The priests and
Levites carried them.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon and the entire community of Israel
present for the occasion sacrificed before the ark sheep and oxen too many to
number or count. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RV href="__P8M.HTM#$RV">1</a></sup></font></sup> The priests brought the ark of the covenant of
the LORD to its place beneath the wings of the cherubim in the sanctuary, the
holy of holies of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cherubim had their wings spread out over
the place of the ark, sheltering the ark and its poles from above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The poles were so long that their ends could be
seen from that part of the holy place adjoining the sanctuary; however, they
could not be seen beyond. (They have remained there to this day.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was nothing in the ark but the two stone
tablets which Moses had put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with
the Israelites at their departure from the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the priests left the holy place, the cloud
filled the temple of the LORD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so that the priests could no longer minister
because of the cloud, since the LORD'S glory had filled the temple of the LORD.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Solomon said, &quot;The LORD intends to
dwell in the dark cloud; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have truly built you a princely house, a
dwelling where you may abide forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king turned and greeted the whole community
of Israel as they stood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them: &quot;Blessed be the LORD, the
God of Israel, who with his own mouth made a promise to my father David and by
his hand has brought it to fulfillment. It was he who said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Since the day I brought my people Israel out
of Egypt, I have not chosen a city out of any tribe of Israel for the building
of a temple to my honor; but I choose David to rule my people Israel.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When my father David wished to build a temple to
the honor of the LORD, the God of Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the LORD said to him, 'In wishing to build a
temple to my honor, you do well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It will not be you, however, who will build the
temple; but the son who will spring from you, he shall build the temple to my
honor.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now the LORD has fulfilled the promise that
he made: I have succeeded my father David and sit on the throne of Israel, as
the LORD foretold, and I have built this temple to honor the LORD, the God of
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have provided in it a place for the ark in
which is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers when he
brought them out of the land of Egypt.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in
the presence of the whole community of Israel, and stretching forth his hands
toward heaven, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, &quot;LORD, God of Israel, there is no
God like you in heaven above or on earth below; you keep your covenant of
kindness with your servants who are faithful to you with their whole heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have kept the promise you made to my father
David, your servant. You who spoke that promise, have this day, by your own
power, brought it to fulfillment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, therefore, LORD, God of Israel, keep the
further promise you made to my father David, your servant, saying, 'You shall
always have someone from your line to sit before me on the throne of Israel,
provided only that your descendants look to their conduct so that they live in
my presence, as you have lived in my presence.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, LORD, God of Israel, may this promise
which you made to my father David, your servant, be confirmed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Can it indeed be that God dwells among
men on earth? If the heavens and the highest heavens cannot contain you, how
much less this temple which I have built! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Look kindly on the prayer and petition of your
servant, O LORD, my God, and listen to the cry of supplication which I, your
servant, utter before you this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May your eyes watch night and day over this
temple, the place where you have decreed you shall be honored; may you heed the
prayer which I, your servant, offer in this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30

your people Israel which they offer in this place. Listen from your heavenly
dwelling and grant pardon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If a man sins against his neighbor and is

<p class=MsoNormal>63
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD
twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king
and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>64
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On that day the king consecrated the middle of
the court facing the temple of the LORD; he offered there the holocausts, the
cereal offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar
before the LORD was too small to hold these offerings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>65
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On this occasion Solomon and all the
Israelites, who had assembled in large numbers from Labo of Hamath to the Wadi
of Egypt, celebrated the festival before the LORD, our God, for seven days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>66
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the eighth day he dismissed the people, who
bade the king farewell and went to their homes, rejoicing and happy over all
the blessings the LORD had given to his servant David and to his people Israel.
