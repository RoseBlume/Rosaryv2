<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 23</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul looked intently at the Sanhedrin and said,
&quot;My brothers, I have conducted myself with a perfectly clear conscience
before God to this day.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The high priest Ananias <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44W href="__PYH.HTM#$44W">1</a></sup></font></sup>
ordered his attendants to strike his mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Paul said to him, &quot;God will strike
you, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44X href="__PYH.HTM#$44X">2</a></sup></font></sup> you whitewashed wall. Do you indeed sit in judgment
upon me according to the law and yet in violation of the law order me to be
struck?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The attendants said, &quot;Would you revile
God's high priest?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul answered, &quot;Brothers, I did not realize
he was the high priest. For it is written, 'You shall not curse a ruler of your
people.'&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44Y href="__PYH.HTM#$44Y">3</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul was aware that some were Sadducees and
some Pharisees, so he called out before the Sanhedrin, &quot;My brothers, I am
a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees; (I) am on trial for hope in the resurrection
of the dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he said this, a dispute broke out between
the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the group became divided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the Sadducees say that there is no
resurrection or angels or spirits, while the Pharisees acknowledge all three. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A great uproar occurred, and some scribes
belonging to the Pharisee party stood up and sharply argued, &quot;We find
nothing wrong with this man. Suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to
him?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The dispute was so serious that the commander,
afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, ordered his troops to go down
and rescue him from their midst and take him into the compound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44Z href="__PYH.HTM#$44Z">4</a></sup></font></sup> The following night the Lord stood by him and
said, &quot;Take courage. For just as you have borne witness to my cause in
Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When day came, the Jews made a plot and bound
themselves by oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were more than forty who formed this
conspiracy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They went to the chief priests and elders and
said, &quot;We have bound ourselves by a solemn oath to taste nothing until we
have killed Paul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You, together with the Sanhedrin, must now make
an official request to the commander to have him bring him down to you, as
though you meant to investigate his case more thoroughly. We on our part are
prepared to kill him before he arrives.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The son of Paul's sister, however, heard about
the ambush; so he went and entered the compound and reported it to Paul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul then called one of the centurions <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-450 href="__PYH.HTM#$450">5</a></sup></font></sup>
and requested, &quot;Take this young man to the commander; he has something to
report to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he took him and brought him to the commander
and explained, &quot;The prisoner Paul called me and asked that I bring this
young man to you; he has something to say to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The commander took him by the hand, drew him
aside, and asked him privately, &quot;What is it you have to report to
me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He replied, &quot;The Jews have conspired to
ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomor row, as though they meant to
inquire about him more thoroughly, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but do not believe them. More than forty of
them are lying in wait for him; they have bound themselves by oath not to eat
or drink until they have killed him. They are now ready and only wait for your
consent.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the commander dismissed the young man he
directed him, &quot;Tell no one that you gave me this information.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he summoned two of the centurions and
said, &quot;Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea by nine o'clock
tonight, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-451 href="__PYH.HTM#$451">6</a></sup></font></sup> along with seventy horsemen and two hundred
auxiliaries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Provide mounts for Paul to ride and give him
safe conduct to Felix the governor.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he wrote a letter with this content: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-452 href="__PYH.HTM#$452">7</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Claudius Lysias to his excellency the
governor Felix, greetings. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-453 href="__PYH.HTM#$453">8</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This man, seized by the Jews and about to be
murdered by them, I rescued after intervening with my troops when I learned
that he was a Roman citizen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I wanted to learn the reason for their
accusations against him so I brought him down to their Sanhedrin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I discovered that he was accused in matters of
controversial questions of their law and not of any charge deserving death or
imprisonment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since it was brought to my attention that there
will be a plot against the man, I am sending him to you at once, and have also
notified his accusers to state (their case) against him before you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the soldiers, according to their orders,
took Paul and escorted him by night to Antipatris. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day they re turned to the compound,
leaving the horsemen to complete the journey with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they arrived in Caesarea they delivered
the letter to the governor and presented Paul to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had read it and asked to what province
he belonged, and learned that he was from Cilicia, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, &quot;I shall hear your case when your
accusers arrive.&quot; Then he ordered that he be held in custody in Herod's
praetorium. </p>

the law (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P23.HTM#PENT.EXO.22.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 22:27), withdraws his accusation
of hypocrisy, &quot;whitewashed wall&quot; (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVW.HTM#GOSP.MAT.23.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew

citizenship, but this is not an exact description of what really happened (see
