<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph could no longer control himself in the
presence of all his attendants, so he cried out, &quot;Have everyone withdraw
from me!&quot; Thus no one else was about when he made himself known to his
brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his sobs were so loud that the Egyptians
heard him, and so the news reached Pharaoh's palace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I am Joseph,&quot; he said to his
brothers. &quot;Is my father still in good health?&quot; But his brothers could
give him no answer, so dumbfounded were they at him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Come closer to me,&quot; he told his
brothers. When they had done so, he said: &quot;I am your brother Joseph, whom
you once sold into Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now do not be distressed, and do not
reproach yourselves for having sold me here. It was really for the sake of
saving lives that God sent me here ahead of you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For two years now the famine has been in the
land, and for five more years tillage will yield no harvest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God, therefore, sent me on ahead of you to
ensure for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives in an extraordinary
deliverance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6D href="__P1B.HTM#$6D">1</a></sup></font></sup> So it was not really you but God who had me
come here; and he has made of me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his
household, and ruler over the whole land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6E href="__P1B.HTM#$6E">2</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Hurry back, then, to my father and tell
him: 'Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come to me
without delay. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6F href="__P1B.HTM#$6F">3</a></sup></font></sup> You will settle in the region of Goshen, where
you will be near me - you and your children and grandchildren, your flocks and
herds, and everything that you own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since five years of famine still lie ahead, I
will provide for you there, so that you and your family and all that are yours
may not suffer want.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Surely, you can see for yourselves, and
Benjamin can see for himself, that it is I, Joseph, who am speaking to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tell my father all about my high position in
Egypt and what you have seen. But hurry and bring my father down here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon he flung himself on the neck of his
brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept in his arms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph then kissed all his brothers, crying
over each of them; and only then were his brothers able to talk with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that
Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and his courtiers were pleased. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Pharaoh told Joseph: &quot;Say to your
brothers: 'This is what you shall do: Load up your animals and go without delay
to the land of Canaan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There get your father and your families, and
then come back here to me; I will assign you the best land in Egypt, where you
will live off the fat of the land.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instruct them further: 'Do this. Take wagons
from the land of Egypt for your children and your wives and to transport your
father on your way back here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not be concerned about your belongings, for
the best in the whole land of Egypt shall be yours.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sons of Israel acted accordingly. Joseph
gave them the wagons, as Pharaoh had ordered, and he supplied them with
provisions for the journey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also gave to each of them fresh clothing, but
to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of garments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, what he sent to his father was ten
jackasses loaded with the finest products of Egypt and ten jennies loaded with
grain and bread and other provisions for his journey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he sent his brothers on their way, he told
them, &quot;Let there be no recriminations on the way.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they left Egypt and made their way to their
father Jacob in the land of Canaan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they told him, &quot;Joseph is still alive
- in fact, it is he who is ruler of all the land of Egypt,&quot; he was
dumbfounded; he could not believe them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they recounted to him all that Joseph
had told them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent for his
transport, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;It is enough,&quot; said Israel. &quot;My
son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.&quot; </p>
