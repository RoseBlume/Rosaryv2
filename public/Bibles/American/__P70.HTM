<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The ark of the LORD had been in the land of the
Philistines seven months </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when they summoned priests and fortune-tellers
to ask, &quot;What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us what we should
send back with it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P3 href="__P70.HTM#$P3">1</a></sup></font></sup> They replied: &quot;If you intend to send away
the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it alone, but must, by all
means, make amends to him through a guilt offering. Then you will be healed,
and will learn why he continues to afflict you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When asked further, &quot;What guilt offering
should be our amends to him?&quot;, they replied: &quot;Five golden hemorrhoids
and five golden mice to correspond to the number of Philistine lords, since the
same plague has struck all of you and your lords. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, make images of the hemorrhoids and
of the mice that are infesting your land and give them as a tribute to the God
of Israel. Perhaps then he will cease to afflict you, your gods, and your land.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why should you become stubborn, as the
Egyptians and Pharaoh were stubborn? Was it not after he had dealt ruthlessly
with them that the Israelites were released and departed? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So now set to work and make a new cart. Then
take two milch cows that have not borne the yoke; hitch them to the cart, but
drive their calves indoors away from them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall next take the ark of the LORD and
place it on the cart, putting in a box beside it the golden articles that you
are offering, as amends for your guilt. Start it on its way, and let it go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then watch! If it goes to Beth-shemesh along
the route to his own territory, he has brought this great calamity upon us; if
not, we will know it was not he who struck us, but that an accident happened to
us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They acted upon this advice. Taking two milch
cows, they hitched them to the cart but shut up their calves indoors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they placed the ark of the LORD on the
cart, along with the box containing the golden mice and the images of the
hemorrhoids. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cows went straight for the route to
Beth-shemesh and continued along this road, mooing as they went, without
turning right or left. The Philistine lords followed them as far as the border
of Beth-shemesh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting the
wheat in the valley. When they looked up and spied the ark, they greeted it
with rejoicing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cart came to the field of Joshua the
Beth-shemite and stopped there. At a large stone in the field, the wood of the
cart was split up and the cows were offered as a holocaust to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Levites, meanwhile, had taken down the ark
of God and the box beside it, in which the golden articles were, and had placed
them on the great stone. The men of Beth-shemesh also offered other holocausts
and sacrifices to the LORD that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After witnessing this, the five Philistine
lords returned to Ekron the same day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The golden hemorrhoids the Philistines sent
back as a guilt offering to the LORD were as follows: one for Ashdod, one for
Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The golden mice, however, corresponded to the
number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords,
including fortified cities and open villages. The large stone on which the ark
of the LORD was placed is still in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite at the
present time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The descendants of Jeconiah did not join in the
celebration with the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh when they greeted the ark of
the LORD, and seventy of them were struck down. The people went into mourning
at this great calamity with which the LORD had afflicted them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The men of Beth-shemesh asked, &quot;Who can
stand in the presence of this Holy One? To whom shall he go from us?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They then sent messengers to the inhabitants of
Kiriath-jearim, saying, &quot;The Philistines have returned the ark of the
LORD; come down and get it.&quot; </p>
