<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, son of man, prophesy to the
mountains of Israel: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy has
said of you, &quot;Ha! the everlasting heights have become our possession&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(therefore prophesy in these words: Thus says
the Lord GOD:); because you have been ridiculed and despised on all sides for
having become a possession for the rest of the nations, and have become a
byword and a popular jeer; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word
of the LORD: (Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and hills, the ravines
and valleys, the desolate ruins and abandoned cities, which have been given
over to the pillage and mockery of the remaining nations round about; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>therefore thus says the Lord GOD:) Truly, with
burning jealousy I speak against the rest of the nations (and against all of
Edom) who with wholehearted joy and utter contempt have considered my land
their possession to be delivered over to plunder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of
Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys: Thus says
the Lord GOD:) With jealous fury I speak, because you have borne the reproach
of the nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore do I solemnly swear that your
neighboring nations shall bear their own reproach. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, mountains of Israel, you shall grow
branches and bear fruit for my people Israel, for they shall soon return. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See, I come to you, it is to you that I turn;
you will be tilled and sown, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and I will settle crowds of men upon you, the
whole house of Israel; cities shall be repeopled, and ruins rebuilt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will settle crowds of men and beasts upon you,
to multiply and be fruitful. I will repeople you as in the past, and be more
generous to you than in the beginning; thus you shall know that I am the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(My people Israel are the ones whom I will have
walk upon you; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their
heritage. Never again shall you rob them of their children.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KQ href="__PS8.HTM#$2KQ">1</a></sup></font></sup> Thus says the Lord GOD: Because they have said
of you, &quot;You are a land that devours men, and you rob your people of their
children&quot;; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>therefore, never again shall you devour men or
rob your people of their children, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No more will I permit you to hear the reproach
of nations, or bear insults from peoples, or rob your people of their children,
says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in
their land, they defiled it by their conduct and deeds. In my sight their conduct
was like the defilement of a menstruous woman. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore I poured out my fury upon them
(because of the blood which they poured out on the ground, and because they
defiled it with idols). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I scattered them among the nations, dispersing
them over foreign lands; according to their conduct and deeds I judged them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they came among the nations (wherever
they came), they served to profane my holy name, because it was said of them:
&quot;These are the people of the LORD, yet they had to leave their land.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So I have relented because of my holy name
which the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they came. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says
the Lord GOD: Not for your sakes do I act, house of Israel, but for the sake of
my holy name, which you profaned among the nations to which you came. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will prove the holiness of my great name,
profaned among the nations, in whose midst you have profaned it. Thus the
nations shall know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when in their sight I
prove my holiness through you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I will take you away from among the
nations, gather you from all the foreign lands, and bring you back to your own
land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will sprinkle clean water upon you to cleanse
you from all your impurities, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will give you a new heart and place a new
spirit within you, taking from your bodies your stony hearts and giving you
natural hearts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will put my spirit within you and make you
live by my statutes, careful to observe my decrees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall live in the land I gave your fathers;
you shall be my people, and I will be your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will save you from all your impurities; I
will order the grain to be abundant, and I will not send famine against you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will increase the fruit on your trees and the
crops in your fields; thus you shall no longer bear among the nations the
reproach of famine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then you shall remember your evil conduct, and
that your deeds were not good; you shall loathe yourselves for your sins and
your abominations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Not for your sakes do I act, says the Lord GOD
- let this be known to you! Be ashamed and abashed because of your conduct, O
house of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: When I purify you from
all your crimes, I will repeople the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the desolate land shall be tilled, which was
formerly a wasteland exposed to the gaze of every passer-by. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This desolate land has been made into a
garden of Eden,&quot; they shall say. &quot;The cities that were in ruins, laid
waste, and destroyed are now repeopled and fortified.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the neighboring nations that remain shall
know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt what was destroyed and replanted what was
desolate. I, the LORD, have promised, and I will do it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: This also I will be
persuaded to do for the house of Israel: to multiply them like sheep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As with sacrificial sheep, the sheep of
Jerusalem on its feast days, the cities which were in ruins shall be filled
with flocks of men; thus they shall know that I am the LORD. </p>
