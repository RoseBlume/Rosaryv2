<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD took note of Sarah as he had said he
would; he did for her as he had promised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sarah became pregnant and bore Abraham a son in
his old age, at the set time that God had stated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham gave the name Isaac to this son of his
whom Sarah bore him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham
circumcised him, as God had commanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son
Isaac was born to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sarah then said, &quot;God has given me cause
to laugh, and all who hear of it will laugh with me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Who would have told Abraham,&quot; she added,
&quot;that Sarah would nurse children! Yet I have borne him a son in his old
age.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Isaac grew, and on the day of the child's
weaning, Abraham held a great feast. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-33 href="__PN.HTM#$33">1</a></sup></font></sup> Sarah noticed the son whom Hagar the Egyptian
had borne to Abraham playing with her son Isaac; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so she demanded of Abraham: &quot;Drive out
that slave and her son! No son of that slave is going to share the inheritance
with my son Isaac!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham was greatly distressed, especially on
account of his son Ishmael. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But God said to Abraham: &quot;Do not be
distressed about the boy or about your slave woman. Heed the demands of Sarah,
no matter what she is asking of you; for it is through Isaac that descendants
shall bear your name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for the son of the slave woman, I will make
a great nation of him also, since he too is your offspring.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-34 href="__PN.HTM#$34">2</a></sup></font></sup> Early the next morning Abraham got some bread
and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. Then, placing the child on her
back, he sent her away. As she roamed aimlessly in the wilderness of
Beer-sheba, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the water in the skin was used up. So she put
the child down under a shrub, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and then went and sat down opposite him, about
a bowshot away; for she said to herself, &quot;Let me not watch to see the
child die.&quot; As she sat opposite him, he began to cry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God heard the boy's cry, and God's messenger
called to Hagar from heaven: &quot;What is the matter, Hagar? Don't be afraid;
God has heard the boy's cry in this plight of his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Arise, lift up the boy and hold him by the
hand; for I will make of him a great nation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
water. She went and filled the skin with water, and then let the boy drink. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in
the wilderness and became an expert bowman, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with his home in the wilderness of Paran. His
mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-35 href="__PN.HTM#$35">3</a></sup></font></sup> About that time Abimelech, accompanied by
Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham: &quot;God is with you in
everything you do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-36 href="__PN.HTM#$36">4</a></sup></font></sup> Therefore, swear to me by God at this place
that you will not deal falsely with me or with my progeny and posterity, but
will act as loyally toward me and the land in which you stay as I have acted
toward you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To this Abraham replied, &quot;I so
swear.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham, however, reproached Abimelech about a
well that Abimelech's men had seized by force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I have no idea who did that,&quot;
Abimelech replied. &quot;In fact, you never told me about it, nor did I ever
hear of it until now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave
them to Abimelech and the two made a pact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham also set apart seven ewe lambs of the
flock, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Abimelech asked him, &quot;What is the
purpose of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham answered, &quot;The seven ewe lambs you
shall accept from me that thus I may have your acknowledgment that the well was
dug by me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-37 href="__PN.HTM#$37">5</a></sup></font></sup> This is why the place is called Beer-sheba;
the two took an oath there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had thus made the pact in Beer-sheba,
Abimelech, along with Phicol, the commander of his army, left and returned to
the land of the Philistines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-38 href="__PN.HTM#$38">6</a></sup></font></sup> Abraham planted a tamarisk at Beer-sheba, and
there he invoked by name the LORD, God the Eternal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines
for many years. </p>

Yahwist source in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PI.HTM#PENT.GEN.16.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 16:5-14; but the two

phrase is translated from an emended form of the Hebrew text. In the current
faulty Hebrew text, Abraham put the bread and the waterskin on Hagar's back,
while her son apparently walked beside her. This reading seems to be a scribal
attempt at harmonizing the present passage with the data of the Priestly
source, in which Ishmael would have been at least fourteen years old when Isaac
was born; compare <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PI.HTM#PENT.GEN.16.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 16:16 with <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PN.HTM#PENT.GEN.21.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
21:5; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PJ.HTM#PENT.GEN.17.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 17:25. But in the
present Elohist story Ishmael is obviously a little boy, not much older than
Isaac; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PH.HTM#PENT.GEN.15.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 15:18.</p>
