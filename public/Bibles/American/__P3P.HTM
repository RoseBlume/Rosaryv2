<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the people complained in the hearing of the
LORD; and when he heard it his wrath flared up so that the fire of the LORD burned
among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the people cried out to Moses, he
prayed to the LORD and the fire died out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DP href="__P3P.HTM#$DP">1</a></sup></font></sup> Hence that place was called Taberah, because
there the fire of the LORD burned among them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The foreign elements among them were so greedy
for meat that even the Israelites lamented again, &quot;Would that we had meat
for food! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We remember the fish we used to eat without cost
in Egypt, and the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now we are famished; we see nothing before
us but this manna.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DQ href="__P3P.HTM#$DQ">2</a></sup></font></sup> Manna was like coriander seed and had the
appearance of bdellium. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had gone about and gathered it up,
the people would grind it between millstones or pound it in a mortar, then cook
it in a pot and make it into loaves, which tasted like cakes made with oil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At night, when the dew fell upon the camp, the
manna also fell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Moses heard the people, family after
family, crying at the entrance of their tents, so that the LORD became very
angry, he was grieved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Why do you treat your servant so
badly?&quot; Moses asked the LORD. &quot;Why are you so displeased with me that
you burden me with all this people? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was it I who conceived all this people? or was
it I who gave them birth, that you tell me to carry them at my bosom, like a
foster father carrying an infant, to the land you have promised under oath to
their fathers? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Where can I get meat to give to all this
people? For they are crying to me, 'Give us meat for our food.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I cannot carry all this people by myself, for
they are too heavy for me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If this is the way you will deal with me, then
please do me the favor of killing me at once, so that I need no longer face
this distress.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Assemble for
me seventy of the elders of Israel, men you know for true elders and
authorities among the people, and bring them to the meeting tent. When they are
in place beside you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will come down and speak with you there. I
will also take some of the spirit that is on you and will bestow it on them,
that they may share the burden of the people with you. You will then not have
to bear it by yourself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;To the people, however, you shall say:
Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, when you shall have meat to eat. For in the
hearing of the LORD you have cried, 'Would that we had meat for food! Oh, how
well off we were in Egypt!' Therefore the LORD will give you meat for food, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and you will eat it, not for one day, or two
days, or five, or ten, or twenty days, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but for a whole month-until it comes out of
your very nostrils and becomes loathsome to you. For you have spurned the LORD
who is in your midst, and in his presence you have wailed, 'Why did we ever
leave Egypt?'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Moses said, &quot;The people around me
include six hundred thousand soldiers; yet you say, 'I will give them meat to
eat for a whole month.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Can enough sheep and cattle be slaughtered for
them? If all the fish of the sea were caught for them, would they have
enough?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD answered Moses, &quot;Is this beyond
the LORD'S reach? You shall see now whether or not what I have promised you
takes place.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Moses went out and told the people what the
LORD had said. Gathering seventy elders of the people, he had them stand around
the tent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DR href="__P3P.HTM#$DR">3</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD then came down in the cloud and spoke
to him. Taking some of the spirit that was on Moses, he bestowed it on the
seventy elders; and as the spirit came to rest on them, they prophesied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now two men, one named Eldad and the other
Medad, were not in the gathering but had been left in the camp. They too had
been on the list, but had not gone out to the tent; yet the spirit came to rest
on them also, and they prophesied in the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So, when a young man quickly told Moses,
&quot;Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp,&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua, son of Nun, who from his youth had been
Moses' aide, said, &quot;Moses, my lord, stop them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Moses answered him, &quot;Are you jealous
for my sake? Would that all the people of the LORD were prophets! Would that
the LORD might bestow his spirit on them all!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses retired to the camp, along with the
elders of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DS href="__P3P.HTM#$DS">4</a></sup></font></sup> There arose a wind sent by the LORD, that
drove in quail from the sea and brought them down over the camp site at a
height of two cubits from the ground for the distance of a day's journey all
around the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DT href="__P3P.HTM#$DT">5</a></sup></font></sup> All that day, all night, and all the next day
the people gathered in the quail. Even the one who got the least gathered ten
homers of them. Then they spread them out all around the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But while the meat was still between their
teeth, before it could be consumed, the LORD'S wrath flared up against the
people, and he struck them with a very great plague. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-DU href="__P3P.HTM#$DU">6</a></sup></font></sup> So that place was named Kibroth-hattaavah,

flights, so that they were easily captured. To give food to the hungry people,
God may have used the natural phenomenon of the annual migration of quail
across the Sinai Peninsula. In the spring large flocks of these birds cross the
Gulf of Aqabah flying toward the west; in the fall they fly back eastward from
the Mediterranean. The sea mentioned here probably refers to the former body of
