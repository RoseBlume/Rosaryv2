<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SX href="__P94.HTM#$SX">1</a></sup></font></sup> A certain woman, the widow of one of the guild
prophets, complained to Elisha: &quot;My husband, your servant, is dead. You
know that he was a God-fearing man, yet now his creditor has come to take my
two children as his slaves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;How can I help you?&quot; Elisha answered
her. &quot;Tell me what you have in the house.&quot; &quot;This servant of
yours has nothing in the house but a jug of oil,&quot; she replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go out,&quot; he said, &quot;borrow vessels
from all your neighbors - as many empty vessels as you can. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then come back and close the door on yourself
and your children; pour the oil into all the vessels, and as each is filled,
set it aside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She went and did so, closing the door on
herself and her children. As they handed her the vessels, she would pour in
oil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all the vessels were filled, she said to
her son, &quot;Bring me another vessel.&quot; &quot;There is none left,&quot;
he answered her. And then the oil stopped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She went and told the man of God, who said,
&quot;Go and sell the oil to pay off your creditor; with what remains, you and
your children can live.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One day Elisha came to Shunem, where there was
a woman of influence, who urged him to dine with her. Afterward, whenever he
passed by, he used to stop there to dine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So she said to her husband, &quot;I know that
he is a holy man of God. Since he visits us often, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>let us arrange a little room on the roof and
furnish it for him with a bed, table, chair, and lamp, so that when he comes to
us he can stay there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sometime later Elisha arrived and stayed in the
room overnight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to his servant Gehazi, &quot;Call
this Shunammite woman.&quot; He did so, and when she stood before Elisha, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he told Gehazi, &quot;Say to her, 'You have
lavished all this care on us; what can we do for you? Can we say a good word
for you to the king or to the commander of the army?'&quot; She replied,
&quot;I am living among my own people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Later Elisha asked, &quot;Can something be done
for her?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot; Gehazi answered. &quot;She has no son, and her
husband is getting on in years.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Call her,&quot; said Elisha. When she had
been called, and stood at the door, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elisha promised, &quot;This time next year you
will be fondling a baby son.&quot; &quot;Please, my lord,&quot; she protested,
&quot;you are a man of God; do not deceive your servant.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet the woman conceived, and by the same time
the following year she had given birth to a son, as Elisha had promised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The day came when the child was old enough to
go out to his father among the reapers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;My head hurts!&quot; he complained to his
father. &quot;Carry him to his mother,&quot; the father said to a servant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The servant picked him up and carried him to
his mother; he stayed with her until noon, when he died in her lap. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The mother took him upstairs and laid him on
the bed of the man of God. Closing the door on him, she went out </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and called to her husband, &quot;Let me have a
servant and a donkey. I must go quickly to the man of God, and I will be
back.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Why are you going to him today?&quot; he
asked. &quot;It is neither the new moon nor the sabbath.&quot; But she bade him
good-bye, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and when the donkey was saddled, said to her
servant: &quot;Lead on! Do not stop my donkey unless I tell you to.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She kept going till she reached the man of God
on Mount Carmel. When he spied her at a distance, the man of God said to his
servant Gehazi: &quot;There is the Shunammite! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SY href="__P94.HTM#$SY">2</a></sup></font></sup> Hurry to meet her, and ask if all is well with
her, with her husband, and with the boy.&quot; &quot;Greetings,&quot; she
replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when she reached the man of God on the
mountain, she clasped his feet. Gehazi came near to push her away, but the man
of God said: &quot;Let her alone, she is in bitter anguish; the LORD hid it
from me and did not let me know.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Did I ask my lord for a son?&quot; she
cried out. &quot;Did I not beg you not to deceive me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SZ href="__P94.HTM#$SZ">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Gird your loins,&quot; Elisha said to
Gehazi, &quot;take my staff with you and be off; if you meet anyone, do not
greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff upon the
boy.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the boy's mother cried out: &quot;As the
LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not release you.&quot; So he
started to go back with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, Gehazi had gone on ahead and had
laid the staff upon the boy, but there was no sound or sign of life. He
returned to meet Elisha and informed him that the boy had not awakened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Elisha reached the house, he found the boy
lying dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went in, closed the door on them both, and
prayed to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he lay upon the child on the bed, placing
his mouth upon the child's mouth, his eyes upon the eyes, and his hands upon
the hands. As Elisha stretched himself over the child, the body became warm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He arose, paced up and down the room, and then
once more lay down upon the boy, who now sneezed seven times and opened his
eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, &quot;Call the
Shunammite.&quot; She came at his call, and Elisha said to her, &quot;Take your
son.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She came in and fell at his feet in gratitude;
then she took her son and left the room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a
famine in the land. Once, when the guild prophets were seated before him, he
said to his servant, &quot;Put the large pot on, and make some vegetable stew
for the guild prophets.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Someone went out into the field to gather herbs
and found a wild vine, from which he picked a clothful of wild gourds. On his
return he cut them up into the pot of vegetable stew without anybody's knowing
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The stew was poured out for the men to eat, but
when they began to eat it, they exclaimed, &quot;Man of God, there is poison in
the pot!&quot; And they could not eat it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Bring some meal,&quot; Elisha said. He
threw it into the pot and said, &quot;Serve it to the people to eat.&quot; And
there was no longer anything harmful in the pot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing the man
of God twenty barely loaves made from the first fruits, and fresh grain in the
ear. &quot;Give it to the people to eat,&quot; Elisha said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his servant objected, &quot;How can I set
this before a hundred men?&quot; &quot;Give it to the people to eat,&quot;
Elisha insisted. &quot;For thus says the LORD, 'They shall eat and there shall
be some left over.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when they had eaten, there was some left
over, as the LORD had said. </p>
