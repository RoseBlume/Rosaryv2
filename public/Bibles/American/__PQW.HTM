<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GH href="__PQW.HTM#$2GH">1</a></sup></font></sup> How lonely she is now, the once crowded city!
Widowed is she who was mistress over nations; The princess among the provinces
has been made a toiling slave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bitterly she weeps at night, tears upon her
cheeks, With not one to console her of all her dear ones; Her friends have all
betrayed her and become her enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah has fled into exile from oppression and
cruel slavery; Yet where she lives among the nations she finds no place to
rest: All her persecutors come upon her where she is narrowly confined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The roads to Zion mourn for lack of pilgrims going
to her feasts; All her gateways are deserted, her priests groan, Her virgins
sigh; she is in bitter grief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Her foes are uppermost, her enemies are at
ease; The LORD has punished her for her many sins. Her little ones have gone
away, captive before the foe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gone from daughter Zion is all her glory: Her
princes, like rams that find no pasture, Have gone off without strength before
their captors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jerusalem is mindful of the days of her
wretched homelessness, When her people fell into enemy hands, and she had no
one to help her; When her foes gloated over her, laughed at her ruin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Through the sin of which she is guilty,
Jerusalem is defiled; All who esteemed her think her vile now that they see her
nakedness; She herself groans and turns away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Her filth is on her skirt; she gave no thought
how she would end. Astounding is her downfall, with no one to console her.
Look, O LORD, upon her misery, for the enemy has triumphed! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The foe stretched out his hand to all her
treasures; She has seen those nations enter her sanctuary Whom you forbade to
come into your assembly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All her people groan, searching for bread; They
give their treasures for food, to retain the breath of life. &quot;Look O LORD,
and see how worthless I have become! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Come, all you who pass by the way, look
and see Whether there is any suffering like my suffering, which has been dealt
me When the LORD afflicted me on the day of his blazing wrath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;From on high he sent fire down into my
very frame; He spread a net for my feet, and overthrew me. He left me desolate,
in pain all the day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GI href="__PQW.HTM#$2GI">2</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;He has kept watch over my sins; by his
hand they have been plaited: They have settled about my neck, he has brought my
strength to its knees; The Lord has delivered me into their grip, I am unable
to rise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;All the mighty ones in my midst the Lord
has cast away; He summoned an army against me to crush my young men; The LORD
has trodden in the wine press virgin daughter Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;At this I weep, my eyes run with tears:
Far from me are all who could console me, any who might revive me; My sons were
reduced to silence when the enemy prevailed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zion stretched out her hands, but there was no
one to console her; The LORD gave orders against Jacob for his neighbors to be
his foes; Jerusalem has become in their midst a thing unclean. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The LORD is just; I had defied his
command. Listen, all you peoples, and behold my suffering: My maidens and my
youths have gone into captivity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GJ href="__PQW.HTM#$2GJ">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;I cried out to my lovers, but they
failed me. My priests and my elders perished in the city; Where they sought
food for themselves, they found it not. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Look, O LORD, upon my distress: all
within me is in ferment, My heart recoils within me from my monstrous
rebellion. In the streets the sword bereaves, at home death stalks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Give heed to my groaning; there is no one
to console me. All my enemies rejoice at my misfortune: it is you who have
wrought it. Bring on the day you have proclaimed, that they may be even as I. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GK href="__PQW.HTM#$2GK">4</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Let all their evil come before you; deal
with them As you have dealt with me for all my sins; My groans are many, and I
am sick at heart.&quot; </p>
