<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>The Catholic
Letters</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In
addition to the thirteen letters attributed to Paul and the Letter to the
Hebrews, the New Testament contains seven other letters. Three of these are
attributed to John, two to Peter, and one each to James and Jude, all
personages of the apostolic age. The term &quot;catholic letter&quot; first
appears, with reference only to 1 John, in the writings of Apollonius of Ephesus,
a second-century apologist, known only from a citation in Eusebius's
Ecclesiastical History. Eusebius himself (A.D. 260-340) used the term to refer
to all seven letters. </p>

<p>The reason for the term
&quot;catholic,&quot; which means &quot;universal,&quot; was the perception
that these letters, unlike those of Paul, which were directed to a particular
local church, were apparently addressed more generally to the universal church.
This designation is not entirely accurate, however. On the one hand, Hebrews
has no specifically identified addressees, and originally this was probably
true of Ephesians as well. On the other hand, 3 John is addressed to a named
individual, 2 John to a specific, though unnamed, community, and 1 Peter to a
number of churches that are specified as being located in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>While all seven of these
writings begin with an epistolary formula, several of them do not appear to be
real letters in the modern sense of the term. In the ancient world it was not unusual
to cast an exhortation in the form of a letter for literary effect, a
phenomenon comparable to the &quot;open letter&quot; that is sometimes used
today.</p>

<p>With the exception of 1
Peter and 1 John, the ancient church showed reluctance to include the catholic
letters in the New Testament canon. The reason for this was widespread doubt
whether they had actually been written by the apostolic figures to whom they
are attributed. The early Christians saw the New Testament as the depository of
apostolic faith; therefore, they wished to include only the testimony of
apostles. Today we distinguish more clearly between the authorship of a work
and its canonicity: even though written by other, later witnesses than those
whose names they bear, these writings nevertheless testify to the apostolic
faith and constitute canonical scripture. By the late fourth or early fifth
centuries, most objections had been overcome in both the Greek and Latin
churches (though not in the Syriac), and all seven of the catholic letters have
since been acknowledged as canonical.</p>
