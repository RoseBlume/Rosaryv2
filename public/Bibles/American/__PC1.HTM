<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 5</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then there rose a great outcry of the common
people and their wives against certain of their fellow Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some said: &quot;We are forced to pawn our sons
and daughters in order to get grain to eat that we may live.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Others said: &quot;We are forced to pawn our
fields, our vineyards, and our houses, that we may have grain during the
famine.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Still others said: &quot;To pay the king's tax
we have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And though these are our own kinsmen and our
children are as good as theirs, we have had to reduce our sons and daughters to
slavery, and violence has been done to some of our daughters! Yet we can do
nothing about it, for our fields and our vineyards belong to others.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I was extremely angry when I heard the reasons
they had for complaint. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Y2 href="__PC1.HTM#$Y2">1</a></sup></font></sup> After some deliberation, I called the nobles
and magistrates to account, saying to them, &quot;You are exacting interest
from your own kinsmen!&quot; I then rebuked them severely, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying to them: &quot;As far as we were able,
we bought back our fellow Jews who had been sold to Gentiles; you, however, are
selling your own brothers, to have them bought back by us.&quot; They remained
silent, for they could find no answer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I continued: &quot;What you are doing is not
good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God, and put an end to the
derision of our Gentile enemies? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I myself, my kinsmen, and my attendants have
lent the people money and grain without charge. Let us put an end to this
usury! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I ask that you return to them this very day
their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, together
with the interest on the money, the grain, the wine, and the oil that you have
lent them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered: &quot;We will return everything
and exact nothing further from them. We will do just what you ask.&quot; Then I
called for the priests and had them administer an oath to these men that they
would do as they had promised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I also shook out the folds of my garment,
saying, &quot;Thus may God shake from his home and his fortune every man who
fails to keep this promise, and may he thus be shaken out and emptied!&quot;
And the whole assembly answered, &quot;Amen,&quot; and praised the LORD. Then
the people did as they had promised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, from the time that King Artaxerxes
appointed me governor in the land of Judah, from his twentieth to his
thirty-second year - during these twelve years neither I nor my brethren lived
from the governor's allowance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The earlier governors, my predecessors, had
laid a heavy burden on the people, taking from them each day forty silver
shekels for their food; then too, their men oppressed the people. But I,
because I feared God, did not act thus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, though I had acquired no land of my
own, I did my part in this work on the wall, and all my men were gathered there
for the work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though I set my table for a hundred and fifty
persons, Jews and magistrates, as well as those who came to us from the nations
round about, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and though the daily preparations were made at
my expense - one beef, six choice muttons, poultry - besides all kinds of wine
in abundance every ten days, despite this I did not claim the governor's
allowance, for the labor lay heavy upon this people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Keep in mind, O my God, in my favor all that I
did for this people. </p>
