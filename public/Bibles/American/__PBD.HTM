<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was
named Abia, daughter of Zechariah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He pleased the LORD just as his forefather
David had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was he who, in the first month of the first
year of his reign, opened the doors of the LORD'S house and repaired them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He summoned the priests and Levites, gathered
them in the open space to the east, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to them: &quot;Listen to me, you
Levites! Sanctify yourselves now and sanctify the house of the LORD, the God of
your fathers, and clean out the filth from the sanctuary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Our fathers acted faithlessly and did evil in
the eyes of the LORD, our God. They abandoned him, turned away their faces from
the LORD'S dwelling, and turned their backs on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also closed the doors of the vestibule,
extinguished the lamps, and refused to burn incense and offer holocausts in the
sanctuary to the honor of the God of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the anger of the LORD has come upon
Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of terror, astonishment and
mockery, as you see with your own eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For our fathers, as you know, fell by the
sword, and our sons, our daughters and our wives have been taken captive
because of this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, I intend to make a covenant with the LORD,
the God of Israel, that his burning anger may withdraw from us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My sons, be not negligent any longer, for it is
you whom the LORD has chosen to stand before him, to minister to him, to be his
ministers and to offer incense.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the Levites arose: Mahath, son of Amasai,
and Joel, son of Azariah, descendants of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari:
Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehallel; of the Gershonites: Joah, son
of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>of the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeuel; of
the sons of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>of the sons of Heman: Jehuel and Shimei; of the
sons of Jeduthun: Shemiah and Uzziel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They gathered their brethren together and
sanctified themselves; then they came as the king had ordered, to cleanse the
LORD'S house in keeping with his words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priests entered the interior of the LORD'S
house to cleanse it; and whatever they found in the LORD'S temple that was
unclean they brought out to the court of the LORD'S house, where the Levites
took it from them and carried it out to the Kidron Valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They began the work of consecration on the
first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they arrived
at the vestibule of the LORD; they consecrated the LORD'S house during eight
days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month, they had finished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and
said: &quot;We have cleansed the entire house of the LORD, the altar of
holocausts with all its utensils, and the table for the showbread with all its
utensils. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the articles which King Ahaz during his
reign had thrown away because of his apostasy, we have restored and
consecrated, and they are now before the LORD'S altar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King Hezekiah hastened to convoke the
princes of the city and went up to the LORD'S house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs and seven
he-goats were brought for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary,
and for Judah, and he ordered the sons of Aaron, the priests, to offer them on
the altar of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They slaughtered the bulls, and the priests
collected the blood and cast it on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams
and cast the blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and cast the
blood on the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the he-goats for the sin offering were led
before the king and the assembly, who laid their hands upon them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priests then slaughtered them and offered
their blood on the altar to atone for the sin of all Israel; for &quot;The
holocaust and the sin offering,&quot; the king had said, &quot;is for all
Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He stationed the Levites in the LORD'S house
with cymbals, harps and lyres according to the prescriptions of David, of Gad
the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the prescriptions were from the
LORD through his prophets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Levites were stationed with the instruments
of David, and the priests with the trumpets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Hezekiah ordered the holocaust to be
sacrificed on the altar, and in the same instant that the holocaust began, they
also began the song of the LORD, to the accompaniment of the trumpets and the
instruments of David, king of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The entire assembly prostrated itself, and they
continued to sing the song and to sound the trumpets until the holocaust had
been completed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the holocaust was completed, the king and
all who were with him knelt and prostrated themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Hezekiah and the princes then commanded
the Levites to sing the praises of the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph
the seer. They sang praises till their joy was full, then fell down and
prostrated themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah now spoke out this command: &quot;You
have undertaken a work for the LORD. Approach, and bring forward the sacrifices
and thank offerings for the house of the LORD.&quot; Then the assembly brought
forward the sacrifices and thank offerings and all the holocausts which were
free-will offerings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The number of holocausts that the assembly
brought forward was seventy oxen, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all
of these as a holocaust to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As consecrated gifts there were six hundred
oxen and three thousand sheep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since the priests were too few in number to be
able to skin all the victims for the holocausts, their brethren the Levites
assisted them until the task was completed and the priests had sanctified
themselves; the Levites, in fact, were more willing than the priests to
sanctify themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Also, the holocausts were many, along with the
fat of the peace offerings and the libations for the holocausts. Thus the
service of the house of the LORD was reestablished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what
God had reestablished for the people, and at how suddenly this had been done. </p>
