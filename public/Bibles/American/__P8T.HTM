<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, son of
Nebat, Abijam became king of Judah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he reigned three years in Jerusalem. His
mother's name was Maacah, daughter of Abishalom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He imitated all the sins his father had
committed before him, and his heart was not entirely with the LORD, his God,
like the heart of his grandfather David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet for David's sake the LORD, his God, gave
him a lamp in Jerusalem, raising up his son after him and permitting Jerusalem
to endure; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because David had pleased the LORD and did not
disobey any of his commands as long as he lived, except in the case of Uriah
the Hittite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of Abijam's acts, with all that he
did, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abijam rested with his ancestors; he was buried
in the City of David, and his son Asa succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of
Israel, Asa, king of Judah, began to reign; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His
grandmother's name was Maacah, daughter of Abishalom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Asa pleased the LORD like his forefather David,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>banishing the temple prostitutes from the land
and removing all the idols his father had made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also deposed his grandmother Maacah from her
position as queen mother, because she had made an outrageous object for
Asherah. Asa cut down this object and burned it in the Kidron Valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The high places did not disappear; yet Asa's
heart was entirely with the LORD as long as he lived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He brought into the temple of the LORD his
father's and his own votive offerings of silver, gold, and various utensils. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was war between Asa and Baasha, king of
Israel, as long as they both reigned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Baasha, king of Israel, attacked Judah and
fortified Ramah to prevent communication with Asa, king of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S9 href="__P8T.HTM#$S9">1</a></sup></font></sup> Asa then took all the silver and gold
remaining in the treasuries of the temple of the LORD and of the royal palace. Entrusting
them to his ministers, King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son
of Hezion, king of Aram, resident in Damascus. He said: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;There is a treaty between you and me, as
there was between your father and my father. I am sending you a present of
silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha, king of Israel, that he may
withdraw from me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ben-hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the
leaders of his troops against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan,
Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinnereth, besides all the land of Naphtali. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Baasha heard of it, he left off fortifying
Ramah, and stayed in Tirzah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King Asa summoned all Judah without
exception, and they carried away the stones and beams with which Baasha was
fortifying Ramah. With them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpeh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Asa, with all his valor
and accomplishments, and the cities he built, are written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah. In his old age, Asa had an infirmity in his
feet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He rested with his ancestors; he was buried in
his forefather's City of David, and his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the second year of Asa, king of Judah,
Nadab, son of Jeroboam, became king of Israel; he reigned over Israel two
years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the LORD'S sight, imitating his
father's conduct and the sin which he had caused Israel to commit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Baasha, son of Ahijah, of the house of
Issachar, plotted against him and struck him down at Gibbethon of the
Philistines, which Nadab and all Israel were besieging. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa,
king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once he was king, he killed off the entire
house of Jeroboam, not leaving a single soul to Jeroboam but destroying him
utterly, according to the warning which the LORD had pronounced through his
servant, Ahijah the Shilonite, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because of the sins Jeroboam committed and
caused Israel to commit, by which he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to
anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Nadab, with all that he
did, are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(There was war between Asa and Baasha, king of

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the third year of Asa, king of Judah,
Baasha, son of Ahijah, began his twenty-four-year reign over Israel in Tirzah. </p>
