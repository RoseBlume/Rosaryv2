<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 36</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah,
king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take a scroll and write on it all the words I
have spoken to you against Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I
first spoke to you, in the days of Josiah, until today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Perhaps, when the house of Judah hears all the
evil I have in mind to do to them, they will turn back each from his evil way,
so that I may forgive their wickedness and their sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jeremiah called Baruch, son of Neriah, who
wrote down on a scroll, as Jeremiah dictated, all the words which the LORD had
spoken to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the ninth month, in the fifth year of
Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, a fast to placate the LORD was
proclaimed for all the people of Jerusalem and all who came from Judah's cities
to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ER href="__PQE.HTM#$2ER">1</a></sup></font></sup> Then Jeremiah charged Baruch: I cannot go to
the house of the LORD; I am prevented from doing so. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do you go on the fast day and read publicly in
the LORD'S house the LORD'S words from the scroll you wrote at my dictation;
read them also to all the men of Judah who come up from their cities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Perhaps they will lay their supplication before
the LORD and will all turn back from their evil way; for great is the fury of
anger with which the LORD has threatened this people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Baruch, son of Neriah, did everything the
prophet Jeremiah commanded; from the book-scroll he read the LORD'S words in
the LORD'S house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ES href="__PQE.HTM#$2ES">2</a></sup></font></sup> It was in the room of Gemariah, son of the
scribe Shaphan, in the upper court of the LORD'S house, at the entrance of the
New Temple-Gate, that Baruch publicly read the words of Jeremiah from his book.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Micaiah, son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan,
heard all the words of the LORD read from the book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2ET href="__PQE.HTM#$2ET">3</a></sup></font></sup> So he went down to the king's palace, into the
scribe's chamber, where the princes were just then in session: Elishama, the
scribe, Delaiah, son of Shemaiah, Elnathan, son of Achbor, Gemariah, son of
Shaphan, Zedekiah, son of Hananiah, and the other princes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To them Micaiah reported all that he had heard
Baruch read publicly from his book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon the princes sent Jehudi, son of
Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to Baruch with the order:
&quot;Come, and bring with you the scroll you read publicly to the
people.&quot; Scroll in hand, Baruch, son of Neriah, went to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Sit down,&quot; they said to him,
&quot;and read it to us.&quot; Baruch read it to them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and when they heard all its words, they were
frightened and said to one another, &quot;We must certainly tell the king all
these things.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they asked Baruch: &quot;Tell us, please,
how you came to write down all these words.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Jeremiah dictated all these words to
me,&quot; Baruch answered them, &quot;and I wrote them down with ink in the
book.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this the princes said to Baruch, &quot;Go
into hiding, you and Jeremiah; let no one know where you are.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Leaving the scroll in safekeeping in the room
of Elishama the scribe, they entered the room where the king was. When they
told him everything that had happened, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he sent Jehudi to fetch the scroll. Jehudi brought
it from the room of Elishama the scribe, and read it to the king and to all the
princes who were in attendance on the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the king was sitting in his winter house,
since it was the ninth month, and fire was burning in a brazier before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EU href="__PQE.HTM#$2EU">4</a></sup></font></sup> Each time Jehudi finished reading three or
four columns, the king would cut off the piece with a scribe's knife and cast
it into the fire in the brazier, until the entire roll was consumed in the
fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hearing all these words did not frighten the
king and his ministers or cause them to rend their garments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah
urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but commanded Jerahmeel, a royal prince, and
Seraiah, son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch, the
secretary, and the prophet Jeremiah. But the LORD kept them concealed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after
the king burned the scroll with the text Jeremiah had dictated to Baruch: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take another scroll, and write on it everything
that the first scroll contained, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, burned up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And against Jehoiakim, king of Judah, say this:
Thus says the LORD: You burned that scroll, saying, &quot;Why did you write on
it: Babylon's king shall surely come and lay waste this land and empty it of
man and beast?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EV href="__PQE.HTM#$2EV">5</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD now says of Jehoiakim, king of Judah:
No descendant of his shall succeed to David's throne; his corpse shall be cast
out, exposed to the heat of day, to the cold of night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will punish him and his descendants and his ministers
for their wickedness; against them and the citizens of Jerusalem and the men of
Judah I will fulfill all the threats of evil which went unheeded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeremiah took another scroll, and gave it to
his secretary, Baruch, son of Neriah; he wrote on it at Jeremiah's dictation
all the words contained in the book which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, had burned
in the fire, and many others of the same kind in addition. </p>
