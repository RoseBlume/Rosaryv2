<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During David's reign there was a famine for
three successive years. David had recourse to the LORD, who said, &quot;There
is bloodguilt on Saul and his family because he put the Gibeonites to
death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to
them. (Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites, but survivors of the Amorites;
and although the Israelites had given them their oath, Saul had attempted to
kill them off in his zeal for the men of Israel and Judah.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to the Gibeonites, &quot;What must I
do for you and how must I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of
the LORD?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Gibeonites answered him, &quot;We have no
claim against Saul and his house for silver or gold, nor is it our place to put
any man to death in Israel.&quot; Then he said, &quot;I will do for you
whatever you propose.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to the king, &quot;As for the man who
was exterminating us and who intended to destroy us that we might have no place
in all the territory of Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>let seven men from among his descendants be
given to us, that we may dismember them before the LORD in Gibeon, on the
LORD'S mountain.&quot; The king replied, &quot;I will give them up.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king, however, spared Meribbaal, son of
Jonathan, son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that formed a bond between
David and Saul's son Jonathan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king took Armoni and Meribbaal, the two
sons that Aiah's daughter Rizpah had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Saul's
daughter Merob that she had borne to Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and surrendered them to the Gibeonites. They
then dismembered them on the mountain before the LORD. The seven fell at the
one time; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest - that
is, at the beginning of the barley harvest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, took sackcloth
and spread it out for herself on the rock from the beginning of the harvest
until rain came down on them from the sky, fending off the birds of the sky
from settling on them by day, and the wild animals by night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David was informed of what Rizpah, Aiah's
daughter, the concubine of Saul, had done, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he went and obtained the bones of Saul and of
his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh-gilead, who had carried them off
secretly from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged
them at the time they killed Saul on Gilboa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had brought up from there the bones of
Saul and of his son Jonathan, the bones of those who had been dismembered were
also gathered up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan
were buried in the tomb of his father Kish at Zela in the territory of
Benjamin. After all that the king commanded had been carried out, God granted
relief to the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was another battle between the
Philistines and Israel. David went down with his servants and fought the
Philistines, but David grew tired. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Dadu, one of the Rephaim, whose bronze spear
weighed three hundred shekels, was about to take him captive. Dadu was girt
with a new sword and planned to kill David, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but Abishai, son of Zeruiah, came to his
assistance and struck and killed the Philistine. Then David's men swore to him,
&quot;You must not go out to battle with us again, lest you quench the lamp of
Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this there was another battle with the
Philistines in Gob. On that occasion Sibbecai, from Husha, killed Saph, one of
the Rephaim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was another battle with the Philistines
in Gob, in which Elhanan, son of Jair from Bethlehem, killed Goliath of Gath,
who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's heddle-bar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was another battle at Gath in which there
was a man of large stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each
foot - twenty-four in all. He too was one of the Rephaim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when he insulted Israel, Jonathan, son of
David's brother Shimei, killed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These four were Rephaim in Gath, and they fell
at the hands of David and his servants. </p>
