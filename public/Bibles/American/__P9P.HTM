<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UF href="__P9P.HTM#$UF">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the tenth month of the ninth year of
Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, and his whole army advanced against Jerusalem, encamped around it, and
built siege walls on every side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The siege of the city continued until the
eleventh year of Zedekiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the ninth day of the fourth month, when
famine had gripped the city, and the people had no more bread, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the city walls were breached. Then the king and
all the soldiers left the city by night through the gate between the two walls
which was near the king's garden. Since the Chaldeans had the city surrounded,
they went in the direction of the Arabah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Chaldean army pursued the king and
overtook him in the desert near Jericho, abandoned by his whole army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king was therefore arrested and brought to
Riblah to the king of Babylon, who pronounced sentence on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had Zedekiah's sons slain before his eyes.
Then he blinded Zedekiah, bound him with fetters, and had him brought to
Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the seventh day of the fifth month (this was
in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan,
captain of the bodyguard, came to Jerusalem as the representative of the king
of Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He burned the house of the LORD, the palace of
the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every large building was destroyed
by fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the Chaldean troops who were with the
captain of the guard tore down the walls that surrounded Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-UG href="__P9P.HTM#$UG">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, led
into exile the last of the people remaining in the city, and those who had
deserted to the king of Babylon, and the last of the artisans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But some of the country's poor, Nebuzaradan,
captain of the guard, left behind as vinedressers and farmers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The bronze pillars that belonged to the house
of the LORD, and the wheeled carts and the bronze sea in the house of the LORD,
the Chaldeans broke into pieces; they carried away the bronze to Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took also the pots, the shovels, the
snuffers, the bowls, the pans and all the bronze vessels used for service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The fire-holders and the bowls which were of
gold or silver the captain of the guard also carried off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The weight in bronze of the two pillars, the
bronze sea, and the wheeled carts, all of them furnishings which Solomon had
made for the house of the LORD, was never calculated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each of the pillars was eighteen cubits high; a
bronze capital five cubits high surmounted each pillar, and a network with
pomegranates encircled the capital, all of bronze; and so for the other pillar,
as regards the network. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The captain of the guard also took Seraiah the
high priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And from the city he took one courtier, a
commander of soldiers, five men in the personal service of the king who were
still in the city, the scribe of the army commander, who mustered the people of
the land, and sixty of the common people still remaining in the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The captain of the guard, Nebuzaradan, arrested
these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king had them struck down and put to death
in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. Thus was Judah exiled from her land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for the people whom he had allowed to remain
in the land of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, appointed as their
governor Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hearing that the king of Babylon had appointed
Gedaliah governor, all the army commanders with their men came to him at
Mizpah: Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, Johanan, son of Kareah, Seraiah, son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah, from Beth-maacah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gedaliah gave the commanders and their men his
oath. &quot;Do not be afraid of the Chaldean officials,&quot; he said to them.
&quot;Remain in the country and serve the king of Babylon, and all will be well
with you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But in the seventh month Ishmael, son of
Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of royal descent, came with ten men, attacked
Gedaliah and killed him, along with the Jews and Chaldeans who were in Mizpah
with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the people, great and small, left with
the army commanders and went to Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of
Jehoiachin, king of Judah, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month,
Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the inaugural year of his own reign, raised
up Jehoiachin, king of Judah, from prison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He spoke kindly to him and gave him a throne
higher than that of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiachin took off his prison garb and ate at
the king's table as long as he lived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The allowance granted him by the king was a
perpetual allowance, in fixed daily amounts, for as long as he lived. </p>
