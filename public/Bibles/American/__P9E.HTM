king of Israel, Amaziah, son of Joash, king of Judah, began to reign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was twenty-five years old when he became
king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother, whose name was
Jehoaddin, was from Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He pleased the LORD, yet not like his
forefather David, since he did just as his father Joash had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the high places did not disappear, but the
people continued to sacrifice and to burn incense on them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Amaziah had the kingdom firmly in hand, he
slew the officials who had murdered the king, his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the children of the murderers he did not
put to death, obeying the LORD'S command written in the book of the law of
Moses, &quot;Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall
children be put to death for their fathers; each one shall die for his own
sin.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amaziah slew ten thousand Edomites in the Salt
Valley, and took Sela in battle. He renamed it Joktheel, the name it has to
this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, son of
Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, with this challenge, &quot;Come, let us
meet face to face.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Jehoash of Israel sent this reply to the
king of Judah: &quot;The thistle of Lebanon sent word to the cedar of Lebanon,
'Give your daughter to my son in marriage,' but an animal of Lebanon passed by
and trampled the thistle underfoot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have indeed conquered Edom, and you have become
ambitious. Enjoy your glory, but stay at home! Why involve yourself and Judah
with you in misfortune and failure?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Amaziah would not listen. King Jehoash of
Israel then advanced, and he and King Amaziah of Judah met in battle at
Beth-shemesh of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Jehoash of Israel captured Amaziah, son of
Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh. He went on to
Jerusalem where he tore down four hundred cubits of the city wall, from the
Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He took all the gold and silver and all the
utensils there were in the temple of the LORD and the treasuries of the palace,
and hostages as well. Then he returned to Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jehoash, his valor, and
how he fought Amaziah, king of Judah, are recorded in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoash rested with his ancestors; he was

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was Azariah who rebuilt Elath and restored
it to Judah, after King Amaziah rested with his ancestors. </p>

reign in Samaria. </p>

Gath-hepher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the LORD saw the very bitter affliction of
Israel, where there was neither slave nor freeman, no one at all to help
Israel. </p>

twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: the reigns of the kings of Judah between
Athaliah and Ahaz are assigned too many years in all to correspond to the
reigns in Israel from Jehu to the fall of Samaria. It seems probable that
Amaziah was murdered as soon as his son Azariah was old enough to rule, and
that Amaziah's reign was nearer nineteen than twenty-nine years. The
correlation, in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P9F.HTM#HIS.2KIN.15.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Kings 15:1 of the beginning of
Azariah's reign with the 27th year of Jeroboam II can hardly be correct; and
