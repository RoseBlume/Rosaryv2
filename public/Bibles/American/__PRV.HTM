<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Son of man, there were two women, daughters of
the same mother, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who even as young girls played the harlot in
Egypt. There the Egyptians caressed their bosoms and fondled their virginal
breasts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2JL href="__PRV.HTM#$2JL">1</a></sup></font></sup> Oholah was the name of the elder, and the name
of her sister was Oholibah. They became mine and bore sons and daughters. (As
for their names: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Oholah became a harlot faithless to me; she
lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, warriors </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>dressed in purple, governors and officers, all
of them attractive young men, knights mounted on horses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus she gave herself as a harlot to them, to
all the elite of the Assyrians, and she defiled herself with all those for whom
she lusted (with all their idols). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She did not give up the harlotry which she had
begun in Egypt, when they had lain with her as a young girl, fondling her
virginal breasts and pouring out their impurities on her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the
Assyrians for whom she had lusted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They exposed her nakedness, her sons and
daughters they took away, and herself they slew with the sword. Thus she became
a byword for women, for they punished her grievously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though her sister Oholibah saw all this, her
lust was more depraved than her sister's, and she outdid her in harlotry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She too lusted after the Assyrians, governors
and officers, warriors impeccably clothed, knights mounted on horses, all of
them attractive young men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I saw that she had defiled herself. Both had
gone down the same path, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>yet she went further in her harlotry. When she
saw men drawn on the wall, the images of Chaldeans drawn with vermillion, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with sashes girded about their waists, flowing
turbans on their heads, all looking like chariot warriors, the portraits of
Babylonians, natives of Chaldea, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>she lusted for them; no sooner had she set eyes
on them than she sent messengers to them in Chaldea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the Babylonians came to her, to the love
couch, and defiled her with their intercourse. As soon as she was defiled by
them, she became disgusted with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Her harlotry was discovered and her shame was
revealed, and I became disgusted with her as I had become disgusted with her
sister. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But she played the harlot all the more,
recalling the days of her girlhood, when she had been a harlot in the land of
Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She lusted for the lechers of Egypt, whose
members are like that of an ass, and whose heat is like that of stallions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You yearned for the lewdness of your girlhood,
when the Egyptians fondled your breasts, caressing your bosom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord GOD: I
will now stir up your lovers against you, those with whom you are disgusted,
and I will bring them against you from every side: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2JM href="__PRV.HTM#$2JM">2</a></sup></font></sup> the men of Babylon and all of Chaldea, Pekod,
Shoa and Koa, along with all those of Assyria, attractive young men, all of
them governors and officers, charioteers and warriors, all of them horsemen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall come against you from the north with
chariots and wagons and many peoples. Shields, bucklers, and helmets they shall
array against you everywhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will leave it to them to judge, and they will
judge you by their own ordinances. I will let loose my jealousy against you, so
that they shall deal with you in fury, cutting off your nose and ears; and what
is left of you shall fall by the sword. They shall take away your sons and
daughters, and what is left of you shall be devoured by fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall strip off your clothes and seize
your splendid ornaments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will put an end to your lewdness and to the
harlotry you began in Egypt; you shall no longer look toward it, nor shall you
remember Egypt again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For thus says the Lord GOD: I am now handing
you over to those whom you hate, to those who fill you with disgust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall deal with you in hatred, seizing all
that you have worked for and leaving you stark naked, so that your indecent
nakedness is exposed. Your lewdness and harlotry </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>have brought these things upon you, because you
played the harlot with the nations by defiling yourself with their idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because you followed in the path of your
sister, I will hand you her cup. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: The cup of your sister
you shall drink, so wide and deep, which holds so much, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Filled with destruction and grief, a cup of
dismay, the cup of your sister. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall drain it dry, and gnaw at the very
sherds of the cup, and you shall tear out your breasts; for I have spoken, says
the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you
have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, it is for you to bear the
penalty of your lewdness and harlotry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to me: Son of man, would you
judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then make known to them their abominations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For they committed adultery, and blood is on
their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; to feed them they
immolated the children they had borne me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(This, too, they did to me: they defiled my
sanctuary and desecrated my sabbaths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the very day they slew their children for
their idols, they entered my sanctuary to desecrate it. Thus they acted within
my house.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2JN href="__PRV.HTM#$2JN">3</a></sup></font></sup> Moreover, they sent for men who had to come
from afar, to whom messengers were sent. And so they came - and for them you
bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and put on ornaments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You sat on a couch prepared for them, with a
table spread before it, on which you had set my incense and oil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then was heard the shout of a carefree mob in
the city, and these were men brought in from the desert, who put bracelets on
the women's arms and splendid diadems on their heads. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So I said: &quot;Oh, this woman jaded with
adulteries! Now they will commit whoredom with her, and as for her. . . .&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And indeed they did come to her as men come to
a harlot. Thus they came to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But just men shall punish them with the
sentence meted out to adulteresses and murderesses, for they have committed
adultery, and blood is on their hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: Summon an assembly
against them, and deliver them over to terror and plunder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The assembly shall stone them and hack them to
pieces with their swords. They shall slay their sons and daughters, and burn
their houses with fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus I will put an end to lewdness in the land,
and all the women will be warned not to imitate your lewdness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall inflict on you the penalty of your
lewdness, and you shall pay for your sins of idolatry. Thus you shall know that
I am the LORD.</p>
