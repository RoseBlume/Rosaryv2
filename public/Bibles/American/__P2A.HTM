<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take the vestments and clothe Aaron with the
tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod itself, and the breastpiece, fastening
the embroidered belt of the ephod around him. </p>

you ordain Aaron and his sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now bring forward the bullock in front of
the meeting tent. There Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on its head. </p>

altar, together with some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle this on Aaron and
his vestments, as well as on his sons and their vestments, that his sons and
their vestments may be sacred. </p>

this is the ordination ram; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally, take the breast of Aaron's ordination
ram and wave it as a wave offering before the LORD; this is to be your own
portion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Such things are due to Aaron and his sons from
the Israelites by a perpetual ordinance as a contribution. From their peace
offerings, too, the Israelites shall make a contribution, their contribution to
the LORD. </p>
