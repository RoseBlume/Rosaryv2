<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 21</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some time after this, as Naboth the Jezreelite
had a vineyard in Jezreel next to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab said to Naboth, &quot;Give me your
vineyard to be my vegetable garden, since it is close by, next to my house. I
will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or, if you prefer, I will give you
its value in money.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The LORD forbid,&quot; Naboth answered
him, &quot;that I should give you my ancestral heritage.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab went home disturbed and angry at the
answer Naboth the Jezreelite had made to him: &quot;I will not give you my
ancestral heritage.&quot; Lying down on his bed, he turned away from food and
would not eat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His wife Jezebel came to him and said to him,
&quot;Why are you so angry that you will not eat?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He answered her, &quot;Because I spoke to
Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Sell me your vineyard, or, if you
prefer, I will give you a vineyard in exchange.' But he refused to let me have
his vineyard.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;A fine ruler over Israel you are
indeed!&quot; his wife Jezebel said to him. &quot;Get up. Eat and be cheerful.
I will obtain the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite for you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and, having
sealed them with his seal, sent them to the elders and to the nobles who lived
in the same city with Naboth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is what she wrote in the letters:
&quot;Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Next, get two scoundrels to face him and accuse
him of having cursed God and king. Then take him out and stone him to
death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His fellow citizens - the elders and the nobles
who dwelt in his city - did as Jezebel had ordered them in writing, through the
letters she had sent them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They proclaimed a fast and placed Naboth at the
head of the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Two scoundrels came in and confronted him with
the accusation, &quot;Naboth has cursed God and king.&quot; And they led him
out of the city and stoned him to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they sent the information to Jezebel that
Naboth had been stoned to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jezebel learned that Naboth had been
stoned to death, she said to Ahab, &quot;Go on, take possession of the vineyard
of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to sell you, because Naboth is not
alive, but dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On hearing that Naboth was dead, Ahab started
off on his way down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take
possession of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Start down to meet Ahab, king of Israel,
who rules in Samaria. He will be in the vineyard of Naboth, of which he has
come to take possession. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SF href="__P8Z.HTM#$SF">1</a></sup></font></sup> This is what you shall tell him, 'The LORD
says: After murdering, do you also take possession? For this, the LORD says: In
the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, the dogs shall lick up
your blood, too.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SG href="__P8Z.HTM#$SG">2</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Have you found me out, my enemy?&quot;
Ahab said to Elijah. &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered. &quot;Because you have given
yourself up to doing evil in the LORD'S sight, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am bringing evil upon you: I will destroy you
and will cut off every male in Ahab's line, whether slave or freeman, in
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will make your house like that of Jeroboam,
son of Nebat, and like that of Baasha, son of Ahijah, because of how you have
provoked me by leading Israel into sin.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Against Jezebel, too, the LORD declared,
&quot;The dogs shall devour Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.&quot;) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When one of Ahab's line dies in the city,
dogs will devour him; when one of them dies in the field, the birds of the sky
will devour him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Indeed, no one gave himself up to the doing of
evil in the sight of the LORD as did Ahab, urged on by his wife Jezebel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He became completely abominable by following
idols, just as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD drove out before the
Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Ahab heard these words, he tore his
garments and put on sackcloth over his bare flesh. He fasted, slept in the
sackcloth, and went about subdued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Have you seen that Ahab has humbled
himself before me? Since he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the
evil in his time. I will bring the evil upon his house during the reign of his
son.&quot; </p>

divine judgment is described in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8Z.HTM#HIS.1KIN.21.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 21:27,
and the consequences are given in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8Z.HTM#HIS.1KIN.21.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$SG href="__P8Z.HTM#-SG">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [20-26] In these verses the Judean
editor of the Books of Kings substitutes, for the message of Elijah prepared
for in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8Z.HTM#HIS.1KIN.21.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 21:19 a sweeping and definitive
judgment against the whole family of Ahab in the same terms as were used
against the families of Jeroboam I (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8S.HTM#HIS.1KIN.14.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 14:9-11)
and Baasha (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8U.HTM#HIS.1KIN.16.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 16:2-4). This judgment is the
fruit of later theological reflection; it is not occasioned directly by the
crime against Naboth, but by the idolatry of Ahab and Jezebel. The judgment on
Jezebel herself (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8Z.HTM#HIS.1KIN.21.23"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 21:23) may have been
uttered by Elijah during the Naboth episode; it finds its fulfillment in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P99.HTM#HIS.2KIN.9.36"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Kings 9:36-37. Still another theological
explanation for the death of Ahab is given by the North Israelite writer of
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8Y.HTM#HIS.1KIN.20.35"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings 20:35-42 above.</p>
