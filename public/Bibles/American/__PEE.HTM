<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Maccabeus and his companions, under the
Lord's leadership, had recovered the temple and the city, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they destroyed the altars erected by the
Gentiles in the marketplace and the sacred enclosures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-163 href="__PEE.HTM#$163">1</a></sup></font></sup> After purifying the temple, they made a new
altar. Then, with fire struck from flint, they offered sacrifice for the first
time in two years, burned incense, and lighted lamps. They also set out the
showbread. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had done this, they prostrated
themselves and begged the Lord that they might never again fall into such
misfortunes, and that if they should sin at any time, he might chastise them
with moderation and not hand them over to blasphemous and barbarous Gentiles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the anniversary of the day on which the
temple had been profaned by the Gentiles, that is, the twenty-fifth of the same
month Chislev, the purification of the temple took place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews celebrated joyfully for eight days as
on the feast of Booths, remembering how, a little while before, they had spent
the feast of Booths living like wild animals in caves on the mountains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Carrying rods entwined with leaves, green
branches and palms, they sang hymns of grateful praise to him who had brought
about the purification of his own Place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By public edict and decree they prescribed that
the whole Jewish nation should celebrate these days every year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Such was the end of Antiochus surnamed
Epiphanes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now we shall relate what happened under
Antiochus Eupator, the son of that godless man, and shall give a summary of the
chief evils caused by the wars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Eupator succeeded to the kingdom, he put a
certain Lysias in charge of the government as commander-in-chief of Coelesyria
and Phoenicia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-164 href="__PEE.HTM#$164">2</a></sup></font></sup> Ptolemy, surnamed Macron, had taken the lead
in treating the Jews fairly because of the previous injustice that had been
done them, and he endeavored to have peaceful relations with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As a result, he was accused before Eupator by
the King's Friends. In fact, on all sides he heard himself called a traitor for
having abandoned Cyprus, which Philometor had entrusted to him, and for having
gone over to Antiochus Epiphanes. Since he could not command the respect due to
his high office, he ended his life by taking poison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-165 href="__PEE.HTM#$165">3</a></sup></font></sup> When Gorgias became governor of the region, he
employed foreign troops and used every opportunity to attack the Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the same time the Idumeans, who held some
important strongholds, were harassing the Jews; they welcomed fugitives from Jerusalem
and endeavored to continue the war. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Maccabeus and his companions, after public
prayers asking God to be their ally, moved quickly against the strongholds of
the Idumeans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Attacking vigorously, they gained control of
the places, drove back all who manned the walls, and cut down those who opposed
them, killing as many as twenty thousand men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When at least nine thousand took refuge in two
very strong towers, containing everything necessary to sustain a siege, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, along with
Zacchaeus and his men, in sufficient numbers to besiege them, while he himself
went off to places where he was more urgently needed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But some of the men in Simon's force who were
money lovers let themselves be bribed by some of the men in the towers; on
receiving seventy thousand drachmas, they allowed a number of them to escape. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Maccabeus was told what had happened, he
assembled the rulers of the people and accused those men of having sold their
kinsmen for money by setting their enemies free to fight against them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he put them to death as traitors, and without
delay captured the two towers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he was successful at arms in all his
undertakings, he destroyed more than twenty thousand men in the two
strongholds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-166 href="__PEE.HTM#$166">4</a></sup></font></sup> Timothy, who had previously been defeated by
the Jews, gathered a tremendous force of foreign troops and collected a large
number of cavalry from Asia; then he appeared in Judea, ready to conquer it by
force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At his approach, Maccabeus and his men made
supplication to God, sprinkling earth upon their heads and girding their loins
in sackcloth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Lying prostrate at the foot of the altar, they
begged him to be gracious to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and a
foe to their foes, as the law declares. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the prayer, they took up their arms and
advanced a considerable distance from the city, halting when they were close to
the enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-167 href="__PEE.HTM#$167">5</a></sup></font></sup> As soon as dawn broke, the armies joined
battle, the one having as pledge of success and victory not only their valor
but also their reliance on the Lord, and the other taking fury as their leader
in the fight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the midst of the fierce battle, there
appeared to the enemy from the heavens five majestic men riding on
golden-bridled horses, who led the Jews on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They surrounded Maccabeus, and shielding him
with their own armor, kept him from being wounded. They shot arrows and hurled
thunderbolts at the enemy, who were bewildered and blinded, thrown into
confusion and routed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Twenty-five hundred of their foot soldiers and
six hundred of their horsemen were slain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Timothy, however, fled to a well-fortified
stronghold called Gazara, where Chaereas was in command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For four days Maccabeus and his men eagerly
besieged the fortress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those inside, relying on the strength of the
place, kept repeating outrageous blasphemies and uttering abominable words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the fifth day dawned, twenty young men in
the army of Maccabeus, angered over such blasphemies, bravely stormed the wall
and with savage fury cut down everyone they encountered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Others who climbed up the same way swung around
on the defenders, taking the besieged in the rear; they put the towers to the
torch, spread the fire and burned the blasphemers alive. Still others broke
down the gates and let in the rest of the troops, who took possession of the
city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-168 href="__PEE.HTM#$168">6</a></sup></font></sup> Timothy had hidden in a cistern, but they
killed him, along with his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On completing these exploits, they blessed,
with hymns of grateful praise, the Lord who shows great kindness to Israel and
grants them victory. </p>
