<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Who would believe what we have heard? To whom
has the arm of the LORD been revealed? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2A8 href="__PP0.HTM#$2A8">1</a></sup></font></sup> He grew up like a sapling before him, like a
shoot from the parched earth; There was in him no stately bearing to make us
look at him, nor appearance that would attract us to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2A9 href="__PP0.HTM#$2A9">2</a></sup></font></sup> He was spurned and avoided by men, a man of
suffering, accustomed to infirmity, One of those from whom men hide their
faces, spurned, and we held him in no esteem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AA href="__PP0.HTM#$2AA">3</a></sup></font></sup> Yet it was our infirmities that he bore, our
sufferings that he endured, While we thought of him as stricken, as one smitten
by God and afflicted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he was pierced for our offenses, crushed
for our sins, Upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole, by his stripes
we were healed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We had all gone astray like sheep, each
following his own way; But the LORD laid upon him the guilt of us all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though he was harshly treated, he submitted and
opened not his mouth; Like a lamb led to the slaughter or a sheep before the
shearers, he was silent and opened not his mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away, and
who would have thought any more of his destiny? When he was cut off from the
land of the living, and smitten for the sin of his people, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A grave was assigned him among the wicked and a
burial place with evildoers, Though he had done no wrong nor spoken any
falsehood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2AB href="__PP0.HTM#$2AB">4</a></sup></font></sup> (But the LORD was pleased to crush him in
infirmity.) If he gives his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his
descendants in a long life, and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished
through him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because of his affliction he shall see the
light in fullness of days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify
many, and their guilt he shall bear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore I will give him his portion among the
great, and he shall divide the spoils with the mighty, Because he surrendered
himself to death and was counted among the wicked; And he shall take away the
sins of many, and win pardon for their offenses. </p>
