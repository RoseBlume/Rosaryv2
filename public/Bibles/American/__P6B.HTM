<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Ephraimites said to him, &quot;What
have you done to us, not calling us when you went to fight against
Midian?&quot; And they quarreled bitterly with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;What have I accomplished now in
comparison with you?&quot; he answered them. &quot;Is not the gleaning of
Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Into your power God delivered the princes of
Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with
you?&quot; When he said this, their anger against him subsided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Gideon reached the Jordan and crossed it
with his three hundred men, they were exhausted and famished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said to the men of Succoth, &quot;Will
you give my followers some loaves of bread? They are exhausted, and I am
pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MY href="__P6B.HTM#$MY">1</a></sup></font></sup> But the princes of Succoth replied, &quot;Are
the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give
food to your army?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon said, &quot;Very well; when the LORD has
delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my power, I will grind your flesh in with the
thorns and briers of the desert.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went up from there to Penuel and made the
same request of them, but the men of Penuel answered him as had the men of
Succoth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So to the men of Penuel, too, he said,
&quot;When I return in triumph, I will demolish this tower.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with
their force of about fifteen thousand men; these were all who were left of the
whole Kedemite army, a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen having fallen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of
Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the camp when it felt secure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zebah and Zalmunna fled. He pursued them and
took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, captive, throwing the entire
army into panic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Gideon, son of Joash, returned from battle
by the pass of Heres. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He captured a young man of Succoth, who upon
being questioned listed for him the seventy-seven princes and elders of
Succoth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went to the men of Succoth and said,
&quot;Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom you taunted me, 'Are the hands of
Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give food to your
weary followers?'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He took the elders of the city, and thorns and
briers of the desert, and ground these men of Succoth into them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also demolished the tower of Penuel and slew
the men of the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, &quot;Where
now are the men you killed at Tabor?&quot; &quot;They all resembled you,&quot;
they replied. &quot;They appeared to be princes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;They were my brothers, my mother's
sons,&quot; he said. &quot;As the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I
should not kill you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to his first-born, Jether,
&quot;Go, kill them.&quot; Since Jether was still a boy, he was afraid and did
not draw his sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zebah and Zalmunna said, &quot;Come, kill us
yourself, for a man's strength is like the man.&quot; So Gideon stepped forward
and killed Zebah and Zalmunna. He also took the crescents that were on the
necks of their camels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites then said to Gideon, &quot;Rule
over us - you, your son, and your son's son - for you rescued us from the power
of Midian.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Gideon answered them, &quot;I will not rule
over you, nor shall my son rule over you. The LORD must rule over you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MZ href="__P6B.HTM#$MZ">2</a></sup></font></sup> Gideon went on to say, &quot;I should like to
make a request of you. Will each of you give me a ring from his booty?&quot;
(For being Ishmaelites, the enemy had gold rings.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We will gladly give them,&quot; they
replied, and spread out a cloak into which everyone threw a ring from his
booty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The gold rings that he requested weighed
seventeen hundred gold shekels, in addition to the crescents and pendants, the
purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and the trappings that were on the
necks of their camels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon made an ephod out of the gold and placed
it in his city Ophrah. However, all Israel paid idolatrous homage to it there,
and caused the ruin of Gideon and his family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus was Midian brought into subjection by the
Israelites; no longer did they hold their heads high. And the land had rest for
forty years, during the lifetime of Gideon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jerubbaal, son of Joash, went back home to
stay. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Gideon had seventy sons, his direct
descendants, for he had many wives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N0 href="__P6B.HTM#$N0">3</a></sup></font></sup> His concubine who lived in Shechem also bore
him a son, whom he named Abimelech. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At a good old age Gideon, son of Joash, died
and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-N1 href="__P6B.HTM#$N1">4</a></sup></font></sup> But after Gideon was dead, the Israelites
again abandoned themselves to the Baals, making Baal of Berith their god </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and forgetting the LORD, their God, who had
delivered them from the power of their enemies all around them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nor were they grateful to the family of
Jerubbaal (Gideon) for all the good he had done for Israel. </p>
