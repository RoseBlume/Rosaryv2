<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SO href="__P92.HTM#$SO">1</a></sup></font></sup> When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to
heaven in a whirlwind, he and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Stay here, please,&quot; Elijah said to
Elisha. &quot;The LORD has sent me on to Bethel.&quot; &quot;As the LORD lives,
and as you yourself live,&quot; Elisha replied, &quot;I will not leave
you.&quot; So they went down to Bethel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>where the guild prophets went out to Elisha and
asked him, &quot;Do you know that the LORD will take your master from over you
today?&quot; &quot;Yes, I know it,&quot; he replied. &quot;Keep still.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Elijah said to him, &quot;Stay here,
please, Elisha, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.&quot; &quot;As the LORD
lives, and as you yourself live,&quot; Elisha replied, &quot;I will not leave
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They went on to Jericho, where the guild
prophets approached Elisha and asked him, &quot;Do you know that the LORD will
take your master from over you today?&quot; &quot;Yes, I know it,&quot; he
replied. &quot;Keep still.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elijah said to Elisha, &quot;Please stay here;
the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.&quot; &quot;As the LORD lives, and as
you yourself live,&quot; Elisha replied, &quot;I will not leave you.&quot; And
so the two went on together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fifty of the guild prophets followed, and when
the two stopped at the Jordan, stood facing them at a distance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up and struck
the water, which divided, and both crossed over on dry ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SP href="__P92.HTM#$SP">2</a></sup></font></sup> When they had crossed over, Elijah said to
Elisha, &quot;Ask for whatever I may do for you, before I am taken from
you.&quot; Elisha answered, &quot;May I receive a double portion of your
spirit.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have asked something that is not
easy,&quot; he replied. &quot;Still, if you see me taken up from you, your wish
will be granted; otherwise not.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they walked on conversing, a flaming chariot
and flaming horses came between them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a
whirlwind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SQ href="__P92.HTM#$SQ">3</a></sup></font></sup> When Elisha saw it happen he cried out,
&quot;My father! my father! Israel's chariots and drivers!&quot; But when he
could no longer see him, Elisha gripped his own garment and tore it in two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he picked up Elijah's mantle which had
fallen from him, and went back and stood at the bank of the Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Wielding the mantle which had fallen from
Elijah, he struck the water in his turn and said, &quot;Where is the LORD, the
God of Elijah?&quot; When Elisha struck the water it divided and he crossed
over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The guild prophets in Jericho, who were on the
other side, saw him and said, &quot;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&quot;
They went to meet him, bowing to the ground before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Among your servants are fifty brave
men,&quot; they said. &quot;Let them go in search of your master. Perhaps the
spirit of the LORD has carried him away to some mountain or some valley.&quot;
&quot;Do not send them,&quot; he answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, they kept urging him, until he was
embarrassed and said, &quot;Send them.&quot; So they sent the fifty men, who
searched for three days without finding him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they returned to Elisha in Jericho, where
he was staying, he said to them, &quot;Did I not tell you not to go?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once the inhabitants of the city complained to
Elisha, &quot;The site of the city is fine indeed, as my lord can see, but the
water is bad and the land unfruitful.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Bring me a new bowl,&quot; Elisha said,
&quot;and put salt into it.&quot; When they had brought it to him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he went out to the spring and threw salt into
it, saying, &quot;Thus says the LORD, 'I have purified this water. Never again
shall death or miscarriage spring from it.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the water has stayed pure even to this day,
just as Elisha prophesied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SR href="__P92.HTM#$SR">4</a></sup></font></sup> From there Elisha went up to Bethel. While he
was on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him.
&quot;Go up, baldhead,&quot; they shouted, &quot;go up, baldhead!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet turned and saw them, and he cursed
them in the name of the LORD. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore
forty-two of the children to pieces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From there he went to Mount Carmel, and thence
he returned to Samaria. </p>
