</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard
that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel, \ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they approached Zerubbabel and the family heads
and said to them, &quot;Let us build with you, for we seek your God just as you
do, and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of
Assyria, who had us brought here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the
family heads of Israel answered them, &quot;It is not your responsibility to
build with us a house for our God, but we alone must build it for the LORD, the
God of Israel, as King Cyrus of Persia has commanded us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon the people of the land set out to
intimidate and dishearten the people of Judah so as to keep them from building.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-XG href="__PBP.HTM#$XG">1</a></sup></font></sup> They also suborned counselors to work against
them and thwart their plans during the remaining years of Cyrus, king of
Persia, and until the reign of Darius, king of Persia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Also at the beginning of the reign of
Ahashuerus they prepared a written accusation against the inhabitants of Judah
and Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-XH href="__PBP.HTM#$XH">2</a></sup></font></sup> Again, in the time of Artaxerxes, Mithredath
wrote in concert with Tabeel and the rest of his fellow officials to
Artaxerxes, king of Persia. The document was written in Aramaic and was
accompanied by a translation. (Aramaic:) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-XI href="__PBP.HTM#$XI">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then Rehum, the governor, and Shimshai, the
scribe, wrote the following letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Rehum, the governor, Shimshai, the
scribe, and their fellow judges, officials, and agents from among the Persian,
Urukian, Babylonian, Susian (that is Elamite), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the other peoples whom the great and
illustrious Assurbanipal transported and settled in the city of Samaria and
elsewhere in the province West-of-Euphrates, as follows. . . .&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is a copy of the letter that they sent to
him: &quot;To King Artaxerxes, your servants, the men of West-of-Euphrates, as
follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let it be known to the king that the Jews who
came up from you to us have arrived at Jerusalem and are now rebuilding this
rebellious and evil city. They are raising up its walls, and the foundations
have already been laid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now let it be known to the king that if this
city is rebuilt and its walls are raised up again, they will no longer pay
taxes, tributes, or tolls; thus it can only result in harm to the throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, since we partake of the salt of the
palace, we ought not simply to look on while the king is being dishonored.
Therefore we have sent this message to inform you, O king, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so that inquiry may be made in the historical
records of your fathers. In the historical records you can discover and verify
that this city is a rebellious city which has proved fatal to kings and
provinces, and that sedition has been fostered there since ancient times. For
that reason this city was destroyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We inform you, O king, that if this city is
rebuilt and its walls are raised up again, by that very fact you will no longer
own any part of West-of-Euphrates.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king sent this answer: &quot;To Rehum, the governor,
Shimshai, the scribe, and their fellow officials living in Samaria and
elsewhere in the province West-of-Euphrates, greetings and the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The communication which you sent us has been
read plainly in my presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When at my command inquiry was made, it was
verified that from ancient times this city has risen up against kings and that
rebellion and sedition have been fostered there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Powerful kings were once in Jerusalem who ruled
over all West-of-Euphrates, and taxes, tributes, and tolls were paid to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give orders, therefore, that will stop the work
of these men. This city may not be rebuilt until a further decree has been
issued by me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take care that you do not neglect this matter,
lest the evil grow to the detriment of the throne.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as a copy of King Artaxerxes' letter
had been read before Rehum, the governor, Shimshai, the scribe, and their
fellow officials, they went in all haste to the Jews in Jerusalem and stopped
their work by force of arms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-XJ href="__PBP.HTM#$XJ">4</a></sup></font></sup> Thus it was that the work on the house of God
in Jerusalem was halted. This inaction lasted until the second year of the
reign of Darius, king of Persia. </p>
