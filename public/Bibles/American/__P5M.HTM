<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD then said to Joshua, &quot;Do not be afraid
or dismayed. Take all the army with you and prepare to attack Ai. I have
delivered the king of Ai into your power, with his people, city, and land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho
and its king; except that you may take its spoil and livestock as booty. Set an
ambush behind the city.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L2 href="__P5M.HTM#$L2">1</a></sup></font></sup> So Joshua and all the soldiers prepared to
attack Ai. Picking out thirty thousand warriors, Joshua sent them off by night </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with these orders: &quot;See that you ambush
the city from the rear, at no great distance; then all of you be on the watch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the people and I will come up to
the city, and when they make a sortie against us as they did the last time, we
will flee from them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They will keep coming out after us until we
have drawn them away from the city, for they will think we are fleeing from
them as we did the last time. When this occurs, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>rise from ambush and take possession of the
city, which the LORD, your God, will deliver into your power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you have taken the city, set it afire in
obedience to the LORD'S command. These are my orders to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua sent them away. They went to the
place of ambush, taking up their position to the west of Ai, toward Bethel.
Joshua, however, spent that night in the plain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning Joshua mustered the army
and went up to Ai at its head, with the elders of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all the troops he led were drawn up in
position before the city, they pitched camp north of Ai, on the other side of
the ravine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(He took about five thousand men and set them
in ambush between Bethel and Ai, west of the city.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the people took up their stations, with
the main body north of the city and the ambush west of it, and Joshua waited
overnight among his troops. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Ai saw this, and he and all his
army came out very early in the morning to engage Israel in battle at the
descent toward the Arabah, not knowing that there was an ambush behind the
city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua and the main body of the Israelites fled
in seeming defeat toward the desert, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>till the last of the soldiers in the city had
been called out to pursue them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since they were drawn away from the city, with
every man engaged in this pursuit of Joshua and the Israelites, not a soldier
remained in Ai (or Bethel), and the city was open and unprotected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD directed Joshua, &quot;Stretch
out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will deliver it into your
power.&quot; Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and as soon as he did so, the men in ambush
rose from their post, rushed in, captured the city, and immediately set it on
fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By the time the men of Ai looked back, the
smoke from the city was already sky-high. Escape in any direction was
impossible, because the Israelites retreating toward the desert now turned on
their pursuers; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for when Joshua and the main body of Israelites
saw that the city had been taken from ambush and was going up in smoke, they
struck back at the men of Ai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since those in the city came out to intercept
them, the men of Ai were hemmed in by Israelites on either side, who cut them
down without any fugitives or survivors </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>except the king, whom they took alive and
brought to Joshua. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the inhabitants of Ai who had pursued the
Israelites into the desert were slain by the sword there in the open, down to
the last man. Then all Israel returned and put to the sword those inside the
city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There fell that day a total of twelve thousand
men and women, the entire population of Ai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua kept the javelin in his hand stretched
out until he had fulfilled the doom on all the inhabitants of Ai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, the Israelites took for themselves as
booty the livestock and the spoil of that city, according to the command of the
LORD issued to Joshua. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua destroyed the place by fire,
reducing it to an everlasting mound of ruins, as it remains today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had the king of Ai hanged on a tree until
evening; then at sunset Joshua ordered the body removed from the tree and cast at
the entrance of the city gate, where a great heap of stones was piled up over
it, which remains to the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L3 href="__P5M.HTM#$L3">2</a></sup></font></sup> Later Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the
God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>of unhewn stones on which no iron tool had been
used, in keeping with the command to the Israelites of Moses, the servant of
the LORD, as recorded in the book of the law. On this altar they offered
holocausts and peace offerings to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There, in the presence of the Israelites,
Joshua inscribed upon the stones a copy of the law written by Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And all Israel, stranger and native alike, with
their elders, officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark facing the
levitical priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. Half
of them were facing Mount Gerizim and half Mount Ebal, thus carrying out the
instructions of Moses, the servant of the LORD, for the blessing of the people
of Israel on this first occasion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then were read aloud all the words of the law,
the blessings and the curses, exactly as written in the book of the law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Every single word that Moses had commanded,
Joshua read aloud to the entire community, including the women and children,
and the strangers who had accompanied Israel. </p>
