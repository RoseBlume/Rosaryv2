</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Moses had finished speaking these words to
all Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to them, &quot;I am now one hundred and
twenty years old and am no longer able to move about freely; besides, the LORD
has told me that I shall not cross this Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It is the LORD, your God, who will cross before
you; he will destroy these nations before you, that you may supplant them. (It
is Joshua who will cross before you, as the LORD promised.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD will deal with them just as he dealt
with Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites whom he destroyed, and with their
country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When, therefore, the LORD delivers them up to
you, you must deal with them exactly as I have ordered you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Be brave and steadfast; have no fear or dread
of them, for it is the LORD, your God, who marches with you; he will never fail
you or forsake you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses summoned Joshua and in the presence
of all Israel said to him, &quot;Be brave and steadfast, for you must being this
people into the land which the LORD swore to their fathers he would give them;
you must put them in possession of their heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It is the LORD who marches before you; he will
be with you and will never fail you or forsake you. So do not fear or be
dismayed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Moses had written down this law, he
entrusted it to the levitical priests who carry the ark of the covenant of the
LORD, and to all the elders of Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JY href="__P5A.HTM#$JY">1</a></sup></font></sup> giving them this order: &quot;On the feast of
Booths, at the prescribed time in the year of relaxation which comes at the end
of every seven-year period, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-JZ href="__P5A.HTM#$JZ">2</a></sup></font></sup> when all Israel goes to appear before the
LORD, your God, in the place which he chooses, you shall read this law aloud in
the presence of all Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Assemble the people - men, women and children,
as well as the aliens who live in your communities - that they may hear it and learn
it, and so fear the LORD, your God, and carefully observe all the words of this
law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their children also, who do not know it yet,
must hear it and learn it, that they too may fear the LORD, your God, as long
as you live on the land which you will cross the Jordan to occupy.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-K0 href="__P5A.HTM#$K0">3</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD said to Moses, &quot;The time is now
approaching for you to die. Summon Joshua, and present yourselves at the
meeting tent that I may give him his commission.&quot; So Moses and Joshua went
and presented themselves at the meeting tent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the LORD appeared at the tent in a column
of cloud, which stood still at the entrance of the tent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Soon you will be
at rest with your fathers, and then this people will take to rendering wanton
worship to the strange gods among whom they will live in the land they are
about to enter. They will forsake me and break the covenant which I have made
with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time my anger will flare up against
them; I will forsake them and hide my face from them, so that they will become
a prey to be devoured, and many evils and troubles will befall them. At that
time they will indeed say, 'Is it not because our God is not among us that
these evils have befallen us?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet I will be hiding my face from them at that
time only because of all the evil they have done in turning to other gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Write out this song, then, for yourselves.
Teach it to the Israelites and have them recite it, so that this song may be a
witness for me against the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For when I have brought them into the land
flowing with milk and honey which I promised on oath to their fathers, and they
have eaten their fill and grown fat, if they turn to other gods and serve them,
despising me and breaking my covenant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>then, when many evils and troubles befall them,
this song, which their descendants will not have forgotten to recite, will bear
witness against them. For I know what they are inclined to do even at the
present time, before I have brought them into the land which I promised on oath
to their fathers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Moses wrote this song that same day, and he
taught it to the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD commissioned Joshua, son of Nun,
and said to him, &quot;Be brave and steadfast, for it is you who must bring the
Israelites into the land which I promised them on oath. I myself will be with
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Moses had finished writing out on a scroll
the words of the law in their entirety, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he gave the Levites who carry the ark of the
covenant of the LORD this order: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Take this scroll of the law and put it
beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD, your God, that there it may be a
witness against you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I already know how rebellious and
stiff-necked you will be. Why, even now, while I am alive among you, you have
been rebels against the LORD! How much more, then, after I am dead! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, assemble all your tribal elders and
your officials before me, that I may speak these words for them to hear, and so
may call heaven and earth to witness against them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I know that after my death you are sure to
become corrupt and to turn aside from the way along which I directed you, so
that evil will befall you in some future age because you have done evil in the LORD'S
sight, and provoked him by your deeds.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses recited the words of this song from
beginning to end, for the whole assembly of Israel to hear: </p>
