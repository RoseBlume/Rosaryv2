<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Gorgias took five thousand infantry and a
thousand picked cavalry, and this detachment set out at night </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in order to attack the camp of the Jews and
take them by surprise. Some men from the citadel were their guides. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judas heard of it, and himself set out with his
soldiers to attack the king's army at Emmaus, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>while the latter's forces were still scattered
away from the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During the night Gorgias came into the camp of
Judas, and found no one there; so he began to hunt for them in the mountains,
saying, &quot;They are fleeing from us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But at daybreak Judas appeared in the plain
with three thousand men, who lacked such armor and swords as they would have
wished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They saw the army of the Gentiles, strong and
breastplated, flanked with cavalry, and made up of expert soldiers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judas said to the men with him: &quot;Do not be
afraid of their numbers or dread their attack. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red
Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So now let us cry to Heaven in the hope that he
will favor us, remember his covenant with our fathers, and destroy this army
before us today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the Gentiles shall know that there is One
who redeems and delivers Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the foreigners looked up and saw them
marching toward them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they came out of their camp for battle, and the
men with Judas blew the trumpet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The battle was joined and the Gentiles were
defeated and fled toward the plain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-124 href="__PDR.HTM#$124">1</a></sup></font></sup> Their whole rearguard fell by the sword, and
they were pursued as far as Gazara and the plains of Judea, to Azotus and
Jamnia. About three thousand of their men fell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Judas and the army returned from the
pursuit, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to the people: &quot;Do not be greedy
for the plunder, for there is a fight ahead of us, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Gorgias and his army are near us on the
mountain. But now stand firm against our enemies and overthrow them. Afterward
you can freely take the plunder.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Judas was finishing this speech, a
detachment appeared, looking down from the mountain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They saw that their army had been put to flight
and their camp was being burned. The smoke that could be seen indicated what
had happened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they realized this, they were terrified;
and when they also saw the army of Judas in the plain ready to attack, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-125 href="__PDR.HTM#$125">2</a></sup></font></sup> they all fled to Philistine territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Judas went back to plunder the camp, and his
men collected much gold and silver, violet and crimson cloth, and great
treasure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they returned, they were singing hymns and
glorifying Heaven, &quot;for he is good, for his mercy endures forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But those of the foreigners who had escaped
went and told Lysias all that had occurred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he heard it he was disturbed and
discouraged, because things in Israel had not turned out as he intended and as
the king had ordered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the following year he gathered together
sixty thousand picked men and five thousand cavalry, to subdue them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-126 href="__PDR.HTM#$126">3</a></sup></font></sup> They came into Idumea and camped at Beth-zur,
and Judas met them with ten thousand men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seeing that the army was strong, he prayed
thus: &quot;Blessed are you, O Savior of Israel, who broke the rush of the
mighty one by the hand of your servant David and delivered the camp of the
Philistines into the hand of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and his armor-bearer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give this army into the hands of your people
Israel; make them ashamed of their troops and their cavalry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Strike them with fear, weaken the boldness of
their strength, and let them tremble at their own destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Strike them down by the sword of those who love
you, that all who know your name may hymn your praise.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they engaged in battle, and about five
thousand of Lysias' men fell in hand-to-hand fighting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-127 href="__PDR.HTM#$127">4</a></sup></font></sup> When Lysias saw his ranks beginning to give
way, and the increased boldness of Judas, whose men were ready either to live
or to die bravely, he withdrew to Antioch and began to recruit mercenaries so
as to return to Judea with greater numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-128 href="__PDR.HTM#$128">5</a></sup></font></sup> Then Judas and his brothers said, &quot;Now
that our enemies have been crushed, let us go up to purify the sanctuary and
rededicate it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the whole army assembled, and went up to
Mount Zion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They found the sanctuary desolate, the altar
desecrated, the gates burnt, weeds growing in the courts as in a forest or on
some mountain, and the priests' chambers demolished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they tore their clothes and made great
lamentation; they sprinkled their heads with ashes </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and fell with their faces to the ground. And
when the signal was given with trumpets, they cried out to Heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judas appointed men to attack those in the
citadel, while he purified the sanctuary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He chose blameless priests, devoted to the law;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>these purified the sanctuary and carried away
the stones of the Abomination to an unclean place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They deliberated what ought to be done with the
altar of holocausts that had been desecrated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The happy thought came to them to tear it down,
lest it be a lasting shame to them that the Gentiles had defiled it; so they
tore down the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They stored the stones in a suitable place on
the temple hill, until a prophet should come and decide what to do with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they took uncut stones, according to the
law, and built a new altar like the former one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also repaired the sanctuary and the
interior of the temple and purified the courts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They made new sacred vessels and brought the
lampstand, the altar of incense, and the table into the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they burned incense on the altar and
lighted the lamps on the lampstand, and these illuminated the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also put loaves on the table and hung up
curtains. Thus they finished all the work they had undertaken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-129 href="__PDR.HTM#$129">6</a></sup></font></sup> Early in the morning on the twenty-fifth day
of the ninth month, that is, the month of Chislev, in the year one hundred and
forty-eight, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they arose and offered sacrifice according to
the law on the new altar of holocausts that they had made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the anniversary of the day on which the
Gentiles had defiled it, on that very day it was reconsecrated with songs,
harps, flutes, and cymbals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people prostrated themselves and adored
and praised Heaven, who had given them success. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For eight days they celebrated the dedication of
the altar and joyfully offered holocausts and sacrifices of deliverance and
praise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They ornamented the facade of the temple with
gold crowns and shields; they repaired the gates and the priests' chambers and
furnished them with doors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was great joy among the people now that
the disgrace of the Gentiles was removed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>59
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-12A href="__PDR.HTM#$12A">7</a></sup></font></sup> Then Judas and his brothers and the entire
congregation of Israel decreed that the days of the dedication of the altar
should be observed with joy and gladness on the anniversary every year for
eight days, from the twenty-fifth day of the month Chislev. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time they built high walls and strong
towers around Mount Zion, to prevent the Gentiles from coming and trampling
over it as they had done before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>61
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judas also placed a garrison there to protect
it, and likewise fortified Beth-zur, that the people might have a stronghold
facing Idumea. </p>
