<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 25</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel died, and all Israel gathered to mourn
him; they buried him at his home in Ramah.Then David went down to the desert of
Maon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a man of Maon who had property in
Carmel; he was very wealthy, owning three thousand sheep and a thousand goats.
At this time he was present for the shearing of his flock in Carmel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man was named Nabal, his wife, Abigail. The
woman was intelligent and attractive, but Nabal himself, a Calebite, was harsh
and ungenerous in his behavior. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David heard in the desert that Nabal was
shearing his flock, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he sent ten young men, instructing them:
&quot;Go up to Carmel. Pay Nabal a visit and greet him in my name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Say to him, 'Peace be with you, my brother, and
with your family, and with all who belong to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have just heard that shearers are with you.
Now, when your shepherds were with us, we did them no injury, neither did they
miss anything all the while they were in Carmel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ask your servants and they will tell you so.
Look kindly on these young men, since we come at a festival time. Please give
your servants and your son David whatever you can manage.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David's young men arrived, they delivered
this message fully to Nabal in David's name, and then waited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Nabal answered the servants of David:
&quot;Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? Nowadays there are many servants
who run away from their masters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Must I take my bread, my wine, my meat that I
have slaughtered for my own shearers, and give them to men who come from I know
not where?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David's young men retraced their steps and
on their return reported to him all that had been said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon David said to his men, &quot;Let
everyone gird on his sword.&quot; And so everyone, David included, girded on
his sword. About four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred
remained with the baggage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Nabal's wife Abigail was informed of this
by one of the servants, who said: &quot;David sent messengers from the desert
to greet our master, but he flew at them screaming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet these men were very good to us. We were
done no injury, neither did we miss anything all the while we were living among
them during our stay in the open country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For us they were like a rampart night and day
the whole time we were pasturing the sheep near them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, see what you can do, for you must realize
that otherwise evil is in store for our master and for his whole family. He is so
mean that no one can talk to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abigail quickly got together two hundred
loaves, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a
hundred cakes of pressed raisins, and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded
them on asses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She then said to her servants, &quot;Go on
ahead; I will follow you.&quot; But she did not tell her husband Nabal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As she came down through a mountain defile
riding on an ass, David and his men were also coming down from the opposite
direction. When she met them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David had just been saying: &quot;Indeed, it
was in vain that I guarded all this man's possessions in the desert, so that he
missed nothing. He has repaid good with evil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May God do thus and so to David, if by morning
I leave a single male alive among all those who belong to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as Abigail saw David, she dismounted
quickly from the ass and, falling prostrate on the ground before David, did him
homage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As she fell at his feet she said: &quot;My
lord, let the blame be mine. Please let your handmaid speak to you, and listen
to the words of your handmaid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q5 href="__P7J.HTM#$Q5">1</a></sup></font></sup> Let not my lord pay attention to that
worthless man Nabal, for he is just like his name. Fool is his name, and he
acts the fool. I, your handmaid, did not see the young men whom my lord sent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q6 href="__P7J.HTM#$Q6">2</a></sup></font></sup> Now, therefore, my lord, as the LORD lives,
and as you live, it is the LORD who has kept you from shedding blood and from
avenging yourself personally. May your enemies and those who seek to harm my
lord become as Nabal! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accept this present, then, which your
maidservant has brought for my lord, and let it be given to the young men who
follow my lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Please forgive the transgression of your
handmaid, for the LORD shall certainly establish a lasting dynasty for my lord,
because your lordship is fighting the battles of the LORD, and there is no evil
to be found in you your whole life long. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q7 href="__P7J.HTM#$Q7">3</a></sup></font></sup> If anyone rises to pursue you and to seek your
life, may the life of my lord be bound in the bundle of the living in the care
of the LORD your God; but may he hurl out the lives of your enemies as from the
hollow of a sling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when the LORD carries out for my lord the
promise of success he has made concerning you, and appoints you as commander
over Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you shall not have this as a qualm or burden on
your conscience, my lord, for having shed innocent blood or for having avenged
yourself personally. When the LORD confers this benefit on your lordship,
remember your handmaid.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to Abigail: &quot;Blessed be the
LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Blessed be your good judgment and blessed be
you yourself, who this day have prevented me from shedding blood and from
avenging myself personally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Otherwise, as the LORD, the God of Israel,
lives, who has restrained me from harming you, if you had not come so promptly
to meet me, by dawn Nabal would not have had a single man or boy left
alive.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then took from her what she had brought
him and said to her: &quot;Go up to your home in peace! See, I have granted
your request as a personal favor.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Abigail came to Nabal, there was a
drinking party in his house like that of a king, and Nabal was merry because he
was very drunk. So she told him nothing at all before daybreak the next
morning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But then, when Nabal had become sober, his wife
told him what had happened. At this his courage died within him, and he became
like a stone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About ten days later the LORD struck him and he
died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On hearing that Nabal was dead, David said:
&quot;Blessed be the LORD, who has requited the insult I received at the hand
of Nabal, and who restrained his servant from doing evil, but has punished
Nabal for his own evil deeds.&quot; David then sent a proposal of marriage to
Abigail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David's servants came to Abigail in
Carmel, they said to her, &quot;David has sent us to you that he may take you
as his wife.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rising and bowing to the ground, she answered,
&quot;Your handmaid would become a slave to wash the feet of my lord's
servants.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She got up immediately, mounted an ass, and
followed David's messengers, with her five maids following in attendance upon
her. She became his wife, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel. Thus
both of them were his wives; but Saul gave David's wife Michal, Saul's own
daughter, to Palti, son of Laish, who was from Gallim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'></i></b></p><br/><br/><hr size=1 width=30% align=left/><font size=3><b><a name=$Q5 href="__P7J.HTM#-Q5">1</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [25] Fool is his name: Nabal in

figure is perhaps taken from the practice of tying up valuables in a kerchief

security, but that his enemies be subject to constant agitation and humiliation
like a stone whirled about, cast out of the sling, and thereafter disregarded.<b
