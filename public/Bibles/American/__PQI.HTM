<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2F5 href="__PQI.HTM#$2F5">1</a></sup></font></sup> This word came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
after Nebuzaradan, captain of the bodyguard, had released him in Ramah, where
he had found him a prisoner in chains, among the captives of Jerusalem and
Judah who were being exiled to Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the captain of the bodyguard took charge
of Jeremiah, he said to him, &quot;The LORD, your God, foretold the ruin of
this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now he has brought about in deed what he
threatened; because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice,
this fate has befallen you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now, I am freeing you today from the
fetters that bind your hands; if it seems good to you to come with me to
Babylon, you may come: I will look after you well. But if it does not please
you to come to Babylon, you need not come. See, the whole land is before you;
go wherever you think good and proper&quot;; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and then, before he left - &quot;or go to
Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed
ruler over the cities of Judah; stay with him among the people, or go wherever
you please.&quot; The captain of the bodyguard gave him food and gifts and let
him go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2F6 href="__PQI.HTM#$2F6">2</a></sup></font></sup> Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, in
Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people left in the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the army leaders who were still in the
field with all their men heard that the king of Babylon had given Gedaliah, son
of Ahikam, charge of the land, of men, women, and children, and of those poor
who had not been led captive to Babylon, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2F7 href="__PQI.HTM#$2F7">3</a></sup></font></sup> they came with their men to Gedaliah in
Mizpah: Ishmael, son of Nethaniah; Johanan, son of Kareah; Seraiah, son of
Tanhumeth; the sons of Ephai of Netophah; and Jezaniah of Beth-maacah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
adjured them and their men not to be afraid to serve the Chaldeans: to stay in
the land and submit to the king of Babylon, for their own welfare; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying that he himself would remain in Mizpah,
as their intermediary with the Chaldeans who should come to them. They were to
collect the wine, the fruit, and the oil, to store them in jars, and to settle
in the cities they occupied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the people of Judah in Moab, those among
the Ammonites, those in Edom, and those in all other lands heard that the king
of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah, and had appointed over them Gedaliah,
son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they all returned to the land of Judah from the
places to which they had scattered. They went to Gedaliah at Mizpah and had a
rich harvest of wine and fruit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Johanan, son of Kareah, and all the leaders
of the armies in the field came to Gedaliah in Mizpah </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2F8 href="__PQI.HTM#$2F8">4</a></sup></font></sup> and asked him whether he did not know that
Baalis, the king of the Ammonites, had sent Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, to
assassinate him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, would not believe
them. Then Johanan, son of Kareah, said secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah:
&quot;Let me go and kill Ishmael, son of Nethaniah; no one will know it. Why
should he be allowed to kill you? All the Jews who have now rallied to you will
be dispersed and the remnant of Judah will perish.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nevertheless, Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, answered
Johanan, son of Kareah, &quot;You shall do nothing of the kind; you have lied
about Ishmael.&quot; </p>
