them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you purchase a Hebrew slave, he is to
serve you for six years, but in the seventh year he shall be given his freedom
without cost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he comes into service alone, he shall leave
alone; if he comes with a wife, his wife shall leave with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if his master gives him a wife and she
bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall remain the
master's property and the man shall leave alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, however, the slave declares, 'I am devoted
to my master and my wife and children; I will not go free,' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8X href="__P22.HTM#$8X">2</a></sup></font></sup> his master shall bring him to God and there,
at the door or doorpost, he shall pierce his ear with an awl, thus keeping him
as his slave forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When a man sells his daughter as a slave,
she shall not go free as male slaves do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8Y href="__P22.HTM#$8Y">3</a></sup></font></sup> But if her master, who had destined her for
himself, dislikes her, he shall let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell
her to a foreigner, since he has broken faith with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he destines her for his son, he shall treat
her like a daughter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he takes another wife, he shall not withhold
her food, her clothing, or her conjugal rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he does not grant her these three things,
she shall be given her freedom absolutely, without cost to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Whoever strikes a man a mortal blow must
be put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He, however, who did not hunt a man down, but
caused his death by an act of God, may flee to a place which I will set apart
for this purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when a man kills another after maliciously
scheming to do so, you must take him even from my altar and put him to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be
put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;A kidnaper, whether he sells his victim
or still has him when caught, shall be put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Whoever curses his father or mother shall
be put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When men quarrel and one strikes the
other with a stone or with his fist, not mortally, but enough to put him in
bed, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the one who struck the blow shall be acquitted,
provided the other can get up and walk around with the help of his staff.
Still, he must compensate him for his enforced idleness and provide for his
complete cure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When a man strikes his male or female
slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be
punished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, however, the slave survives for a day or
two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When men have a fight and hurt a pregnant
woman, so that she suffers a miscarriage, but no further injury, the guilty one
shall be fined as much as the woman's husband demands of him, and he shall pay
in the presence of the judges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8Z href="__P22.HTM#$8Z">4</a></sup></font></sup> But if injury ensues, you shall give life for
life, </p>

foot for foot, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for
stripe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When a man strikes his male or female
slave in the eye and destroys the use of the eye, he shall let the slave go
free in compensation for the eye. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he knocks out a tooth of his male or female
slave, he shall let the slave go free in compensation for the tooth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When an ox gores a man or a woman to
death, the ox must be stoned; its flesh may not be eaten. The owner of the ox,
however, shall go unpunished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if an ox was previously in the habit of
goring people and its owner, though warned, would not keep it in; should it
then kill a man or a woman, not only must the ox be stoned, but its owner also
must be put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, however, a fine is imposed on him, he must
pay in ransom for his life whatever amount is imposed on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This law applies if it is a boy or a girl that
the ox gores. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if it is a male or a female slave that it
gores, he must pay the owner of the slave thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
must be stoned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When a man uncovers or digs a cistern and
does not cover it over again, should an ox or an ass fall into it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the owner of the cistern must make good by
restoring the value of the animal to its owner; the dead animal, however, he
may keep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When one man's ox hurts another's ox so
badly that it dies, they shall sell the live ox and divide this money as well
as the dead animal equally between them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if it was known that the ox was previously
in the habit of goring and its owner would not keep it in, he must make full
restitution, an ox for an ox; but the dead animal he may keep. (v
37) <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-90 href="__P22.HTM#$90">5</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;When a man steals an ox or a sheep and
slaughters or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for the one ox, and four
sheep for the one sheep. </p>
