<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king was shaken, and went up to the room
over the city gate to weep. He said as he wept, &quot;My son Absalom! My son,
my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my
son!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab was told that the king was weeping and
mourning for Absalom; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and that day's victory was turned into mourning
for the whole army when they heard that the king was grieving for his son. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The soldiers stole into the city that day like
men shamed by flight in battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the king covered his face and cried
out in a loud voice, &quot;My son Absalom! Absalom! My son, my son!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joab went to his residence and said:
&quot;Though they saved your life and your sons' and daughters' lives, also the
lives of your wives and those of your concubines, you have put all your
servants to shame today </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>by loving those who hate you and hating those
who love you. For you have shown today that officers and servants mean nothing
to you. Indeed I am now certain that if Absalom were alive today and all of us
dead, you would think that more suitable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now then, get up! Go out and speak kindly to
your servants. I swear by the LORD that if you do not go out, not a single man
will remain with you overnight, and this will be a far greater disaster for you
than any that has afflicted you from your youth until now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king stepped out and sat at the gate.
When all the people were informed that the king was sitting at the gate, they
came into his presence. Now the Israelites had fled to their separate tents, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but throughout the tribes of Israel all the
people were arguing among themselves, saying to one another: &quot;The king
delivered us from the clutches of our enemies, and it was he who rescued us
from the grip of the Philistines. But now he has fled from the country before
Absalom, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Absalom, whom we anointed over us, died in
battle. Why, then, should you remain silent about restoring the king to his
palace?&quot; When the talk of all Israel reached the king, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David sent word to the priests Zadok and
Abiathar: &quot;Say to the elders of Judah: 'Why should you be last to restore
the king to his palace? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You are my brothers, you are my bone and flesh.
Why should you be last to restore the king?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Also say to Amasa: 'Are you not my bone and
flesh? May God do thus and so to me, if you do not become my general
permanently in place of Joab.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He won over all the Judahites as one man, and
so they summoned the king to return, with all his servants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king, on his return, reached the
Jordan, Judah had come to Gilgal to meet him and to escort him across the
Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shimei, son of Gera, the Benjaminite from
Bahurim, hurried down with the Judahites to meet King David, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>accompanied by a thousand men from Benjamin.
Ziba, too, the servant of the house of Saul, accompanied by his fifteen sons
and twenty servants, hastened to the Jordan before the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They crossed over the ford to bring the king's
household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei, son of Gera, crossed
the Jordan, he fell down before the king </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to him: &quot;May my lord not hold me
guilty, and may he not remember and take to heart the wrong that your servant
did the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For your servant knows that he has done wrong.
Yet realize that I have been the first of the whole house of Joseph to come
down today to meet my lord the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Abishai, son of Zeruiah, countered:
&quot;Shimei must be put to death for this. He cursed the LORD'S
anointed.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David replied: &quot;What has come between you
and me, sons of Zeruiah, that you would create enmity for me this day? Should
anyone die today in Israel? Am I not aware that today I am king of
Israel?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said to Shimei, &quot;You shall
not die.&quot; And the king gave him his oath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meribbaal, son of Saul, also went down to meet
the king. He had not washed his feet nor trimmed his mustache nor washed his
clothes from the day the king left until he returned safely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king,
the king asked him, &quot;Why did you not go with me, Meribbaal?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He replied: &quot;My lord the king, my servant
betrayed me. For your servant, who is lame, said to him, 'Saddle the ass for
me, that I may ride on it and go with the king.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he slandered your servant before my lord
the king. But my lord the king is like an angel of God. Do what you judge best.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For though my father's entire house deserved
only death from my lord the king, yet you placed your servant among the guests
at your table. What right do I still have to make further appeal to the
king?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king said to him: &quot;Why do you go
on talking? I say, 'You and Ziba shall divide the property.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meribbaal answered the king, &quot;Indeed let
him have it all, now that my lord the king has returned safely to his
palace.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from
Rogelim and escorted the king to the Jordan for his crossing, taking leave of
him there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was Barzillai, a very old man of eighty and
very wealthy besides, who had provisioned the king during his stay in Mahanaim.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king said to Barzillai, &quot;Cross over
with me, and I will provide for your old age as my guest in Jerusalem.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Barzillai answered the king: &quot;How much
longer have I to live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am now eighty years old. Can I distinguish
between good and bad? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks, or still
appreciate the voices of singers and songstresses? Why should your servant be
any further burden to my lord the king? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In escorting the king across the Jordan, your
servant is doing little enough! Why should the king give me this reward? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Please let your servant go back to die in his
own city by the tomb of his father and mother. Here is your servant Chimham.
Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you will.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said to him, &quot;Chimham shall
come over with me, and I will do for him as you would wish. And anything else
you would like me to do for you, I will do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the people crossed over the Jordan but
the king remained; he kissed Barzillai and bade him Godspeed as he returned to
his own district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally the king crossed over to Gilgal,
accompanied by Chimham. All the people of Judah and half of the people of
Israel had escorted the king across. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But all these Israelites began coming to the
king and saying, &quot;Why did our brothers the Judahites steal you away and
escort the king and his household across the Jordan, along with all David's
men?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the Judahites replied to the men of Israel:
&quot;Because the king is our relative. Why are you angry over this affair?
Have we had anything to eat at the king's expense? Or have portions from his
table been given to us?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites answered the Judahites: &quot;We
have ten shares in the king. Also, we are the first-born rather than you. Why
do you slight us? Were we not first to speak of restoring the king?&quot; Then
the Judahites in turn spoke even more fiercely than the Israelites. </p>
