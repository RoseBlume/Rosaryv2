<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he brought me to the nave and measured the
pilasters, which were six cubits thick on either side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and
the walls at either side of it measured five cubits each. He measured the
length of the nave, which was found to be forty cubits, while its width was
twenty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he went in beyond and measured the
pilasters flanking that entrance, which were two cubits; the width of the
entrance was six cubits, and the walls at either side of it extended seven
cubits each. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He measured the space beyond the nave, twenty
cubits long and twenty cubits wide, and said to me, &quot;This is the holy of
holies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he measured the wall of the temple, which
was six cubits thick; the side chambers, which extended all the way around the
temple, had a width of four cubits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were thirty side chambers built one above
the other in three stories, and there were offsets in the outside wall of the
temple that enclosed the side chambers; these served as supports, so that there
were no supports in the temple wall proper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a broad circular passageway that led
upward to the side chambers, for the temple was enclosed all the way around and
all the way upward; therefore the temple had a broad way running upward so that
one could pass from the lowest to the middle and the highest story. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About the temple was a raised pavement
completely enclosing it - the foundations of the side chambers - a full rod of
six cubits in extent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The width of the outside wall which enclosed
the side chambers was five cubits. Between the side chambers of the temple </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the chambers of the court was an open space
twenty cubits wide going all around the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The side chambers had entrances to the open
space, one entrance on the north and another on the south. The width of the
wall surrounding the open space was five cubits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L5 href="__PSD.HTM#$2L5">1</a></sup></font></sup> The building fronting the free area on the
west side was seventy cubits front to back; the wall of the building was five
cubits thick all around, and it measured ninety cubits from side to side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He measured the temple, which was one hundred
cubits long. The free area, together with the building and its walls, was a
hundred cubits in length. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The facade of the temple, along with the free
area, on the east side, was one hundred cubits wide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He measured the building which lay the length
of the free area and behind it, and together with its walls on both sides it
was one hundred cubits. The inner nave and the outer vestibule </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>were paneled with precious wood all around,
covered from the ground to the windows. There were splayed windows with
trellises about them (facing the threshold). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As high as the lintel of the door, even into
the interior part of the temple as well as outside, on every wall on every side
in both the inner and outer rooms were carved </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the figures of cherubim and palmtrees: a
palmtree between every two cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a man's face looking at a palmtree on one side,
and a lion's face looking at a palmtree on the other; thus they were figured on
every side throughout the whole temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the ground to the lintel of the door the
cherubim and palmtrees were carved on the walls. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The way into the nave was a square doorframe.
In front of the holy place was something that looked like </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L6 href="__PSD.HTM#$2L6">2</a></sup></font></sup> a wooden altar, three cubits in height, two
cubits long, and two cubits wide. It had corners, and its base and sides were
of wood. He said to me, &quot;This is the table which is before the LORD.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The nave had a double door, and also the holy
place had </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a double door. Each door had two movable
leaves; two leaves were on one doorjamb and two on the other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Carved upon them (on the doors of the nave)
were cherubim and palmtrees, like those carved on the walls. Before the
vestibule outside was a wooden lattice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were splayed windows (and palmtrees) on
both side walls of the vestibule, and the side chambers of the temple. . . .</p>
