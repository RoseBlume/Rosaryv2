<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 9</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's
fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with subtle questions, accompanied by a
very numerous retinue and by camels bearing spices, much gold, and precious
stones. She came to Solomon and questioned him on every subject in which she
was interested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon explained to her everything she asked
about, and there remained nothing hidden from Solomon that he could not explain
to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the queen of Sheba witnessed Solomon's
wisdom, the palace he had built, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the food at his table, the seating of his
ministers, the attendance of his servants and their dress, his cupbearers and
their dress, and the holocausts he offered in the house of the LORD, it took
her breath away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The account I heard in my country about
your deeds and your wisdom is true,&quot; she told the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Yet I did not believe the report until I
came and saw with my own eyes. I have discovered that they did not tell me the
half of your great wisdom; you have surpassed the stories I heard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Happy are your men, happy these servants of
yours, who stand before you always and listen to your wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Blessed be the LORD, your God, who has been so
pleased with you as to place you on his throne as king for the LORD, your God.
Because your God has so loved Israel as to will to make it last forever, he has
appointed you over them as king to administer right and justice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty
gold talents and a very large quantity of spices, as well as precious stones.
There was no other spice like that which the queen of Sheba gave to King
Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The servants of Huram and of Solomon who
brought gold from Ophir also brought cabinet wood and precious stones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With the cabinet wood the king made stairs for
the temple of the LORD and the palace of the king; also lyres and harps for the
chanters. The like of these had not been seen before in the land of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything
she desired and asked him for, more than she had brought to the king. Then she
returned to her own country with her servants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The gold that Solomon received each year
weighed six hundred and sixty-six gold talents, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in addition to what was collected from
travelers and what the merchants brought. All the kings of Arabia also, and the
governors of the country, brought gold and silver to Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, King Solomon made two hundred large
shields of beaten gold, six hundred shekels of beaten gold going into each
shield, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and three hundred bucklers of beaten gold, three
hundred shekels of gold going into each buckler; these the king put in the hall
of the Forest of Lebanon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon also made a large ivory throne
which he overlaid with fine gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The throne had six steps; a footstool of gold
was fastened to it, and there was an arm on each side of the seat, with two
lions standing beside the arms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Twelve other lions also stood there, one on
either side of each step. Nothing like this had ever been produced in any other
kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Furthermore, all of King Solomon's drinking
vessels were of gold, and all the utensils in the hall of the Forest of Lebanon
were of pure gold; silver was not considered of value in Solomon's time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the king had ships that went to Tarshish
with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the fleet of Tarshish would
return with a cargo of gold and silver, ivory, apes and monkeys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus King Solomon surpassed all the other kings
of the earth in riches as well as in wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the kings of the earth sought audience with
Solomon, to hear from him the wisdom which God had put in his heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Year in and year out, each one would bring his
tribute-silver and gold articles, garments, weapons, spices, horses and mules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon also had four thousand stalls of
horses, chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he assigned to the
chariot cities and to the king in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was ruler over all the kings from the River
to the land of the Philistines and down to the border of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as
stones, while cedars became as numerous as the sycamores of the foothills. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WC href="__PAT.HTM#$WC">1</a></sup></font></sup> Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt
and from all the lands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Solomon, first and
last, are written, as is well known, in the acts of Nathan the prophet, in the
prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer which
concern Jeroboam, son of Nebat. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
for forty years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He rested with his ancestors; he was buried in
his father's City of David, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king. </p>
