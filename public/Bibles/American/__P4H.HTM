<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When we did turn and proceed into the
desert on the Red Sea road, as the LORD had commanded me, we circled around the
highlands of Seir for a long time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally the LORD said to me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'You have wandered round these highlands long
enough; turn and go north. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give this order to the people: You are now
about to pass through the territory of your kinsmen, the descendants of Esau,
who live in Seir. Though they are afraid of you, be very careful </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>not to come in conflict with them, for I will
not give you so much as a foot of their land, since I have already given Esau
possession of the highlands of Seir. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall purchase from them with silver the
food you eat and the well water you drink. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD, your God, has blessed you in all your
undertakings; he has been concerned about your journey through this vast
desert. It is now forty years that he has been with you, and you have never
been in want.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Then we left behind us the Arabah route,
Elath, Ezion-geber, and Seir, where our kinsmen, the descendants of Esau, live;
and we went on toward the desert of Moab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the LORD said to me, 'Do not show hostility
to the Moabites or engage them in battle, for I will not give you possession of
any of their land, since I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their
own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Formerly the Emim lived there, a people strong
and numerous and tall like the Anakim; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>like them they were considered Rephaim. It was
the Moabites who called them Emim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Seir, however, the former inhabitants were
the Horites; the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, clearing them out of
the way and taking their place, just as the Israelites have done in the land of
their heritage which the LORD has given them.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Get ready, then, to cross the Wadi Zered.' So
we crossed it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thirty-eight years had elapsed between our
departure from Kadesh-barnea and that crossing; in the meantime the whole
generation of soldiers had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn they
should. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For it was the LORD'S hand that was against
them, till he wiped them out of the camp completely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;When at length death had put an end to
all the soldiers among the people, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the LORD said to me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'You are now about to leave Ar and the
territory of Moab behind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As you come opposite the Ammonites, do not show
hostility or come in conflict with them, for I will not give you possession of
any land of the Ammonites, since I have given it to the descendants of Lot as
their own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(This also was considered a country of the
Rephaim from its former inhabitants, whom the Ammonites called Zamzummim, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a people strong and numerous and tall like the
Anakim. But these, too, the LORD cleared out of the way for the Ammonites, who
ousted them and took their place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had done the same for the descendants of
Esau, who dwell in Seir, by clearing the Horites out of their way, so that the
descendants of Esau have taken their place down to the present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-HG href="__P4H.HTM#$HG">1</a></sup></font></sup> So also the Caphtorim, migrating from Caphtor,
cleared away the Avvim, who once dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, and took
their place.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;'Advance now across the Wadi Arnon. I now
deliver into your hands Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin
the occupation; engage him in battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This day I will begin to put a fear and dread
of you into every nation under the heavens, so that at the mention of your name
they will quake and tremble before you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;So I sent messengers from the desert of
Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with this offer of peace: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Let me pass through your country by the
highway; I will go along it without turning aside to the right or to the left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the food I eat which you will supply, and
for the water you give me to drink, you shall be paid in silver. Only let me
march through, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir
and the Moabites who dwell in Ar have done, until I cross the Jordan into the
land which the LORD, our God, is about to give us.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Sihon, king of Heshbon, refused to let us
pass through his land, because the LORD, your God, made him stubborn in mind
and obstinate in heart that he might deliver him up to you, as indeed he has
now done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Then the LORD said to me, 'Now that I
have already begun to hand over to you Sihon and his land, begin the actual
occupation.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Sihon and all his people advanced against us
to join battle at Jahaz; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but since the LORD, our God, had delivered him
to us, we defeated him and his sons and all his people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-HH href="__P4H.HTM#$HH">2</a></sup></font></sup> At that time we seized all his cities and
doomed them all, with their men, women and children; we left no survivor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Our only booty was the livestock and the loot
of the captured cities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon and
from the city in the wadi itself, as far as Gilead, no city was too well
fortified for us to whom the LORD had delivered them up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, in obedience to the command of the
LORD, our God, you did not encroach upon any of the Ammonite land, neither the
region bordering on the Wadi Jabbok, nor the cities of the highlands. </p>
