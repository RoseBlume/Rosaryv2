<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, from a flask he had with him, Samuel
poured oil on Saul's head; he also kissed him, saying: &quot;The LORD anoints
you commander over his heritage. You are to govern the LORD'S people Israel,
and to save them from the grasp of their enemies round about. &quot;This will
be the sign for you that the LORD has anointed you commander over his heritage:
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PB href="__P74.HTM#$PB">1</a></sup></font></sup> When you leave me today, you will meet two men
near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin, who will say to you,
'The asses you went to look for have been found. Your father is no longer
worried about the asses, but is anxious about you and says, What shall I do
about my son?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Farther on, when you arrive at the terebinth of
Tabor, you will be met by three men going up to God at Bethel; one will be
bringing three kids, another three loaves of bread, and the third a skin of
wine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They will greet you and offer you two wave
offerings of bread, which you will take from them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PC href="__P74.HTM#$PC">2</a></sup></font></sup> After that you will come to Gibeath-elohim,
where there is a garrison of the Philistines. As you enter that city, you will
meet a band of prophets, in a prophetic state, coming down from the high place
preceded by lyres, tambourines, flutes and harps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The spirit of the LORD will rush upon you, and
you will join them in their prophetic state and will be changed into another
man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you see these signs fulfilled, do whatever
you judge feasible, because God is with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PD href="__P74.HTM#$PD">3</a></sup></font></sup> Now go down ahead of me to Gilgal, for I shall
come down to you, to offer holocausts and to sacrifice peace offerings. Wait
seven days until I come to you; I shall then tell you what you must do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave him
another heart. That very day all these signs came to pass. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PE href="__P74.HTM#$PE">4</a></sup></font></sup> When they were going from there to Gibeah, a
band of prophets met him, and the spirit of God rushed upon him, so that he
joined them in their prophetic state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all who had known him previously saw him
in a prophetic state among the prophets, they said to one another, &quot;What
has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And someone from that district added, &quot;And
who is their father?&quot; Thus the proverb arose, &quot;Is Saul also among the
prophets?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he came out of the prophetic state, he
went home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul's uncle inquired of him and his servant,
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; Saul replied, &quot;To look for the asses.
When we could not find them, we went to Samuel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul's uncle said, &quot;Tell me, then,
what Samuel said to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul said to his uncle, &quot;He assured us
that the asses had been found.&quot; But he mentioned nothing to him of what
Samuel had said about the kingship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel called the people together to the LORD
at Mizpah </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and addressed the Israelites: &quot;Thus says
the LORD, the God of Israel, 'It was I who brought Israel up from Egypt and
delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all the
kingdoms that oppressed you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But today you have rejected your God, who
delivers you from all your evils and calamities, by saying to him, 'Not so, but
you must appoint a king over us.' Now, therefore, take your stand before the
LORD according to tribes and families.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come
forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Next he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward
in clans, and the clan of Matri was chosen, and finally Saul, son of Kish, was
chosen. But they looked for him in vain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again they consulted the LORD, &quot;Has he
come here?&quot; The LORD answered, &quot;He is hiding among the baggage.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They ran to bring him from there; and when he
stood among the people, he was head and shoulders above all the crowd. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel said to all the people, &quot;Do you see
the man whom the LORD has chosen? There is none like him among all the
people!&quot; Then all the people shouted, &quot;Long live the king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PF href="__P74.HTM#$PF">5</a></sup></font></sup> Samuel next explained to the people the law of
royalty and wrote it in a book, which he placed in the presence of the LORD.
This done, Samuel dismissed the people, each to his own place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul also went home to Gibeah, accompanied by
warriors whose hearts the LORD had touched. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But certain worthless men said, &quot;How can
this fellow save us?&quot; They despised him and brought him no present. </p>
