</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NS href="__P6N.HTM#$NS">1</a></sup></font></sup> So all the Israelites came out as one man:
from Dan to Beer-sheba, and from the land of Gilead, the community was gathered
to the LORD at Mizpah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The leaders of all the people and all the
tribesmen of Israel, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who were swordsmen,
presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, the Benjaminites heard that the
Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. The Israelites asked to be told how the crime
had taken place, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the Levite, the husband of the murdered
woman, testified: &quot;My concubine and I went into Gibeah of Benjamin for the
night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the citizens of Gibeah rose up against me
by night and surrounded the house in which I was. Me they attempted to kill,
and my concubine they abused so that she died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So I took my concubine and cut her up and sent
her through every part of the territory of Israel, because of the monstrous
crime they had committed in Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NT href="__P6N.HTM#$NT">2</a></sup></font></sup> Now that you are all here, O Israelites, state
what you propose to do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people rose as one man to say,
&quot;None of us is to leave for his tent or return to his home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now as for Gibeah, this is what we will do: We
will proceed against it by lot, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>taking from all the tribes of Israel ten men
for every hundred, a hundred for every thousand, a thousand for every ten
thousand, and procuring supplies for the soldiers who will go to deal fully and
suitably with Gibeah of Benjamin for the crime it committed in Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When, therefore, all the men of Israel without
exception were leagued together against the city, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NU href="__P6N.HTM#$NU">3</a></sup></font></sup> the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the
tribe of Benjamin to say, &quot;What is this evil which has occurred among you?
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now give up these corrupt men of Gibeah, that
we may put them to death and thus purge the evil from Israel.&quot; But the
Benjaminites refused to accede to the demand of their brothers, the Israelites.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead, the Benjaminites assembled from their
other cities to Gibeah, to do battle with the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The number of the Benjaminite swordsmen from
the other cities on that occasion was twenty-six thousand, in addition to the
inhabitants of Gibeah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Included in this total were seven hundred
picked men who were left-handed, every one of them able to sling a stone at a
hair without missing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the other Israelites who, without Benjamin,
mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen ready for battle, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NV href="__P6N.HTM#$NV">4</a></sup></font></sup> moved on to Bethel and consulted God. When the
Israelites asked who should go first in the attack on the Benjaminites, the
LORD said, &quot;Judah shall go first.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day the Israelites advanced on Gibeah
with their forces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the day the Israelites drew up in battle
array at Gibeah for the combat with Benjamin, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Benjaminites came out of the city and
felled twenty-two thousand men of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the Israelites went up and wept before the
LORD until evening. &quot;Shall I again engage my brother Benjamin in
battle?&quot; they asked the LORD; and the LORD answered that they should. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But though the Israelite soldiers took courage
and again drew up for combat in the same place as on the previous day, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when they met the Benjaminites for the second
time, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>once again the Benjaminites who came out of
Gibeah against them felled eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them swordsmen.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the entire Israelite army went up to Bethel,
where they wept and remained fasting before the LORD until evening of that day,
besides offering holocausts and peace offerings before the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Israelites consulted the LORD (for the
ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, was
ministering to him in those days), and asked, &quot;Shall I go out again to
battle with Benjamin, my brother, or shall I desist?&quot; the LORD said,
&quot;Attack! for tomorrow I will deliver him into your power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NW href="__P6N.HTM#$NW">5</a></sup></font></sup> So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites went up against the Benjaminites
for the third time and formed their line of battle at Gibeah as on other
occasions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Benjaminites went out to meet them, and in the
beginning they killed off about thirty of the Israelite soldiers in the open
field, just as on the other occasions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the Benjaminites thought, &quot;We
are defeating them as before&quot;; not realizing that disaster was about to overtake
them. The Israelites, however, had planned the flight so as to draw them away
from the city onto the highways. They were drawn away from the city onto the
highways, of which the one led to Bethel, the other to Gibeon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And then all the men of Israel rose from their
places. They re-formed their ranks at Baal-tamar, and the Israelites in ambush
rushed from their place west of Gibeah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>ten thousand picked men from all Israel, and
advanced against the city itself. In a fierce battle, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel; and
on that day the Israelites killed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of
Benjamin, all of them swordsmen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To the Benjaminites it had looked as though the
enemy were defeated, for the men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, trusting in
the ambush they had set at Gibeah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But then the men in ambush made a sudden dash
into Gibeah, overran it, and put the whole city to the sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, the other Israelites had agreed with the
men in ambush on a smoke signal they were to send up from the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And though the men of Benjamin had begun by
killing off some thirty of the men of Israel, under the impression that they
were defeating them as surely as in the earlier fighting, the Israelites
wheeled about to resist </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as the smoke of the signal column began to rise
up from the city. It was when Benjamin looked back and saw the whole city in
flames against the sky </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that the men of Israel wheeled about. Therefore
the men of Benjamin were thrown into confusion, for they realized the disaster
that had overtaken them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They retreated before the men of Israel in the
direction of the desert, with the fight being pressed against them. In their
very midst, meanwhile, those who had been in the city were spreading
destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The men of Benjamin had been surrounded, and
were now pursued to a point east of Gibeah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>while eighteen thousand of them fell, warriors
to a man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest turned and fled through the desert to the
rock Rimmon. But on the highways the Israelites picked off five thousand men
among them, and chasing them up to Gidom, killed another two thousand of them
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those of Benjamin who fell on that day were in
all twenty-five thousand swordsmen, warriors to a man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But six hundred others who turned and fled
through the desert reached the rock Rimmon, where they remained for four
months. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The men of Israel withdrew through the
territory of the Benjaminites, putting to the sword the inhabitants of the
cities, the livestock, and all they chanced upon. Moreover they destroyed by
fire all the cities they came upon. </p>

<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P85.HTM#HIS.2SAM.16.20"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Sam 16:20. The Levite undoubtedly addressed

in punishing the crime. Since they failed to respond, special messengers were
sent asking them to deliver up the guilty ones. They replied by gathering their
forces for combat.</p>

assurance of immediate success. Only after the Israelites were punished at the
