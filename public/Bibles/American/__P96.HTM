<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 6</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The guild prophets once said to Elisha:
&quot;There is not enough room for us to continue to live here with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let us go to the Jordan, where by getting one
beam apiece we can build ourselves a place to live.&quot; &quot;Go,&quot;
Elisha said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Please agree to accompany your
servants,&quot; one of them requested. &quot;Yes, I will come,&quot; he
replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went with them, and when they arrived at
the Jordan they began to fell trees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While one of them was felling a tree trunk, the
iron axhead slipped into the water. &quot;O master,&quot; he cried out,
&quot;it was borrowed!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Where did it fall?&quot; asked the man of
God. When he pointed out the spot, Elisha cut off a stick, threw it into the
water, and brought the iron to the surface. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Pick it up,&quot; he said. And the man
reached down and grasped it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king of Aram was waging war on Israel,
he would make plans with his servants to attack a particular place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the man of God would send word to the king
of Israel, &quot;Be careful! Do not pass by this place, for Aram will attack
there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king of Israel would send word to the
place which the man of God had indicated, and alert it; then they would be on
guard. This happened several times. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Greatly disturbed over this, the king of Aram
called together his officers. &quot;Will you not tell me,&quot; he asked them,
&quot;who among us is for the king of Israel?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;No one, my lord king,&quot; answered one
of the officers. &quot;The Israelite prophet Elisha can tell the king of Israel
the very words you speak in your bedroom.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go, find out where he is,&quot; he said,
&quot;so that I may take him captive.&quot; Informed that Elisha was in Dothan,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he sent there a strong force with horses and
chariots. They arrived by night and surrounded the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning, when the attendant of
the man of God arose and went out, he saw the force with its horses and
chariots surrounding the city. &quot;Alas!&quot; he said to Elisha. &quot;What
shall we do, my lord?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Do not be afraid,&quot; Elisha answered.
&quot;Our side outnumbers theirs.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he prayed, &quot;O LORD, open his eyes,
that he may see.&quot; And the LORD opened the eyes of the servant, so that he
saw the mountainside filled with horses and fiery chariots around Elisha. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Arameans came down to get him, Elisha
prayed to the LORD, &quot;Strike this people blind, I pray you.&quot; And in
answer to the prophet's prayer the LORD struck them blind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Elisha said to them: &quot;This is the
wrong road, and this is the wrong city. Follow me! I will take you to the man
you want.&quot; And he led them to Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they entered Samaria, Elisha prayed,
&quot;O LORD, open their eyes that they may see.&quot; The LORD opened their
eyes, and they saw that they were inside Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king of Israel saw them, he asked,
&quot;Shall I kill them, my father?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T3 href="__P96.HTM#$T3">1</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;You must not kill them,&quot; replied
Elisha. &quot;Do you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword or
bow? Serve them bread and water. Let them eat and drink, and then go back to
their master.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king spread a great feast for them. When
they had eaten and drunk he sent them away, and they went back to their master.
No more Aramean raiders came into the land of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, Ben-hadad, king of Aram, mustered
his whole army and laid siege to Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because of the siege the famine in Samaria was
so severe that an ass's head sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a fourth of
a kab of wild onion for five pieces of silver. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One day, as the king of Israel was walking on
the city wall, a woman cried out to him, &quot;Help, my lord king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;the LORD help
you! Where could I find help for you: from the threshing floor or the
winepress?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king asked her, &quot;What is your
trouble?&quot; She replied: &quot;This woman said to me, 'Give up your son that
we may eat him today; then tomorrow we will eat my son.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day I
said to her, 'Now give up your son that we may eat him.' But she hid her
son.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king heard the woman's words, he tore
his garments. And as he was walking on the wall, the people saw that he was
wearing sackcloth underneath, next to his skin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;May God do thus and so to me,&quot; the
king exclaimed, &quot;if the head of Elisha, son of Shaphat, stays on him
today!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, Elisha was sitting in his house in
conference with the elders. The king had sent a man ahead before he himself
should come to him. Elisha had said to the elders: &quot;Do you know that this
son of a murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? When the messenger
comes, see that you close the door and hold it fast against him. His master's
footsteps are echoing behind him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While Elisha was still speaking, the king came
down to him and said, &quot;This evil is from the LORD. Why should I trust in
the LORD any longer?&quot; </p>
