<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While they were worshiping the Lord and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The inhabitants of Jerusalem and their leaders

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the congregation had dispersed, many Jews

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the following sabbath almost the whole city

jealousy and with violent abuse contradicted what Paul said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and
said, &quot;It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first, but
since you reject it and condemn yourselves as unworthy of eternal life, we now
turn to the Gentiles. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42T href="__PY7.HTM#$42T">12</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I have made
you a light to the Gentiles, that you may be an instrument of salvation to the
ends of the earth.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Gentiles were delighted when they heard
this and glorified the word of the Lord. All who were destined for eternal life
came to believe, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the word of the Lord continued to spread
through the whole region. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews, however, incited the women of
prominence who were worshipers and the leading men of the city, stirred up a
persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they shook the dust from their feet in protest

Paul and Barnabas at Pisidian Antioch (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY7.HTM#GOSP.ACT.13.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts

was favorably received. Some Jews and &quot;God-fearers&quot; (see the note on
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY2.HTM#GOSP.ACT.8.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 8:26-40) became interested and invited the

Gentiles from the city had so disconcerted the Jews that they became hostile
toward the apostles (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY7.HTM#GOSP.ACT.13.44"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:44-50). This
hostility of theirs appears in all three accounts of Paul's missionary journeys

(&quot;every believer&quot;). But this seems the only passage about Paul in
Acts where justification is mentioned. In Lucan fashion it is paralleled with
&quot;forgiveness of sins&quot; (a theme at <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXW.HTM#GOSP.ACT.2.38"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
2:38; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXX.HTM#GOSP.ACT.3.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 3:19;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.31"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 5:31; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY4.HTM#GOSP.ACT.10.43"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 10:43) based
on Jesus' resurrection (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY7.HTM#GOSP.ACT.13.37"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:37) rather than
his cross, and is put negatively (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY7.HTM#GOSP.ACT.13.38"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:38).
Therefore, some would translate, &quot;in regard to everything from which you
could not be acquitted . . . every believer is acquitted.&quot;</p>

frustrates God's plan for his chosen people; however, no adverse judgment is
made here concerning their ultimate destiny. Again, Luke, in the words of Paul,
speaks of the priority of Israel in the plan for salvation (see
