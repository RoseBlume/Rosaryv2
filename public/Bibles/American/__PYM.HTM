<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 28</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once we had reached safety we learned that the
island was called Malta. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The natives showed us extraordinary
hospitality; they lit a fire and welcomed all of us because it had begun to
rain and was cold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was
putting it on the fire when a viper, escaping from the heat, fastened on his
hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the natives saw the snake hanging from his
hand, they said to one another, &quot;This man must certainly be a murderer;
though he escaped the sea, Justice <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45Q href="__PYM.HTM#$45Q">1</a></sup></font></sup> has not let him remain
alive.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he shook the snake off into the fire and
suffered no harm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly
to fall down dead but, after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual
happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the vicinity of that place were lands
belonging to a man named Publius, the chief of the island. He welcomed us and
received us cordially as his guests for three days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It so happened that the father of Publius was
sick with a fever and dysentery. Paul visited him and, after praying, laid his
hands on him and healed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this had taken place, the rest of the
sick on the island came to Paul and were cured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They paid us great honor and when we eventually
set sail they brought us the provisions we needed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Three months later we set sail on a ship that
had wintered at the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the Dioscuri <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45R href="__PYM.HTM#$45R">2</a></sup></font></sup>
as its figurehead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three
days, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and from there we sailed round the coast and
arrived at Rhegium. After a day, a south wind came up and in two days we
reached Puteoli. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There we found some brothers and were urged to
stay with them for seven days. And thus we came to Rome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The brothers from there heard about us and came
as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them,
Paul gave thanks to God and took courage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he entered Rome, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45S href="__PYM.HTM#$45S">3</a></sup></font></sup> Paul
was allowed to live by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45T href="__PYM.HTM#$45T">4</a></sup></font></sup> Three days later he called together the
leaders of the Jews. When they had gathered he said to them, &quot;My brothers,
although I had done nothing against our people or our ancestral customs, I was
handed over to the Romans as a prisoner from Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After trying my case the Romans wanted to
release me, because they found nothing against me deserving the death penalty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the Jews objected, I was obliged to
appeal to Caesar, even though I had no accusation to make against my own
nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is the reason, then, I have requested to
see you and to speak with you, for it is on account of the hope of Israel <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45U href="__PYM.HTM#$45U">5</a></sup></font></sup>
that I wear these chains.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered him, &quot;We have received no
letters from Judea about you, nor has any of the brothers arrived with a
damaging report or rumor about you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But we should like to hear you present your
views, for we know that this sect is denounced everywhere.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they arranged a day with him and came to his
lodgings in great numbers. From early morning until evening, he expounded his
position to them, bearing witness to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them
about Jesus from the law of Moses and the prophets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some were convinced by what he had said, while
others did not believe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45V href="__PYM.HTM#$45V">6</a></sup></font></sup> Without reaching any agreement among
themselves they began to leave; then Paul made one final statement. &quot;Well
did the holy Spirit speak to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah, saying:
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Go to this people and say: You shall indeed
hear but not understand. You shall indeed look but never see. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gross is the heart of this people; they will
not hear with their ears; they have closed their eyes, so they may not see with
their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and be
converted, and I heal them.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let it be known to you that this salvation of
God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45W href="__PYM.HTM#$45W">7</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-45X href="__PYM.HTM#$45X">8</a></sup></font></sup> He remained for two full years in his
lodgings. He received all who came to him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and with complete assurance and without
hindrance he proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus
Christ. </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$45S href="__PYM.HTM#-45S">3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [16] With Paul's arrival in Rome,
the programmatic spread of the word of the Lord to &quot;the ends of the
earth&quot; (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:8) is accomplished. In Rome,
Paul is placed under house arrest, and under this mild form of custody he is
allowed to proclaim the word in the capital of the civilized world of his day.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$45T href="__PYM.HTM#-45T">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [17-22] Paul's first act in Rome is
to learn from the leaders of the Jewish community whether the Jews of Jerusalem
plan to pursue their case against him before the Roman jurisdiction. He is
informed that no such plan is afoot, but that the Jews of Rome have heard the
Christian teaching denounced. Paul's offer to explain it to them is readily
accepted.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$45U href="__PYM.HTM#-45U">5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [20] The hope of Israel: in the
words of Paul (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYH.HTM#GOSP.ACT.23.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 23:6), Luke has identified
this hope as hope in the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$45V href="__PYM.HTM#-45V">6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [25-28] Paul's final words in Acts reflect
a major concern of Luke's writings: how the salvation promised in the Old
Testament, accomplished by Jesus, and offered first to Israel
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY7.HTM#GOSP.ACT.13.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 13:26), has now been offered to and
accepted by the Gentiles. Quoting <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNP.HTM#PROPHB.ISA.6.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah 6:9-10,
Paul presents the scriptural support for his indictment of his fellow Jews who
refuse to accept the message he proclaims. Their rejection leads to its
proclamation among the Gentiles.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$45W href="__PYM.HTM#-45W">7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [29] The Western text has added
here a verse that is not found in the best Greek manuscripts: &quot;And when he
had said this, the Jews left, seriously arguing among themselves.&quot;</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$45X href="__PYM.HTM#-45X">8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [30-31] Although the ending of Acts
may seem to be abrupt, Luke has now completed his story with the establishment
of Paul and the proclamation of Christianity in Rome. Paul's confident and
unhindered proclamation of the gospel in Rome forms the climax to the story
whose outline was provided in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:8 - &quot;You
will be my witnesses in Jerusalem . . . and to the ends of the earth.&quot;</p>
