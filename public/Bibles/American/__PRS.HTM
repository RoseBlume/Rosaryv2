<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2JA href="__PRS.HTM#$2JA">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the
fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to consult the LORD and sat down
before me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Son of man, speak with the elders of Israel and
say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD: Have you come to consult me? As I live! I
swear I will not allow myself to be consulted by you, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Will you judge them? Will you judge, son of
man? Make known to them the abominations of their ancestors </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in these words: Thus speaks the Lord GOD: The
day I chose Israel, I swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob; in the
land of Egypt I revealed myself to them and swore: I am the LORD, your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That day I swore to bring them out of the land
of Egypt to the land I had scouted for them, a land flowing with milk and
honey, a jewel among all lands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I said to them: Throw away, each of you,
the detestable things that have held your eyes; do not defile yourselves with
the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD, your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they rebelled against me and refused to
listen to me; none of them threw away the detestable things that had held their
eyes, they did not abandon the idols of Egypt. Then I thought of pouring out my
fury on them and spending my anger on them there in the land of Egypt; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but I acted for my name's sake, that it should
not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were, in whose
presence I had made myself known to them, revealing that I would bring them out
of the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore I led them out of the land of Egypt
and brought them into the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I gave them my statutes and made known to
them my ordinances, which everyone must keep, to have life through them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I also gave them my sabbaths to be a sign
between me and them, to show that it was I, the LORD, who made them holy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in
the desert. They did not observe my statutes, and they despised my ordinances
that bring life to those who keep them. My sabbaths, too, they desecrated
grievously. Then I thought of pouring out my fury on them in the desert to put
an end to them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but I acted for my name's sake, that it should
not be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose presence I had brought
them out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nevertheless I swore to them in the desert not
to bring them to the land I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey,
a jewel among all lands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So much were their hearts devoted to their
idols, they had not lived by my statutes, but despised my ordinances and
desecrated my sabbaths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I looked on them with pity, not wanting to
destroy them, so I did not put an end to them in the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I said to their children in the desert: Do
not observe the statutes of your parents or keep their ordinances; do not
defile yourselves with their idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am the LORD, your God: observe my statutes
and be careful to keep my ordinances; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>keep holy my sabbaths, as a sign between me and
you to show that I am the LORD, your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But their children rebelled against me: they
did not observe my statutes or keep my ordinances that bring life to those who
observe them, and my sabbaths they desecrated. Then I thought of pouring out my
fury on them, of spending my anger on them in the desert; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but I stayed my hand, acting for my name's
sake, lest it be profaned in the sight of the nations in whose presence I
brought them out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nevertheless I swore to them in the desert that
I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them over foreign lands; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for they did not keep my ordinances, but
despised my statutes and desecrated my sabbaths, with eyes only for the idols
of their fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2JB href="__PRS.HTM#$2JB">2</a></sup></font></sup> Therefore I gave them statutes that were not
good, and ordinances through which they could not live. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I let them become defiled by their gifts, by
their immolation of every first-born, so as to make them an object of horror. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of
man, and tell them: Thus says the Lord GOD: In this way also your fathers
blasphemed me, breaking faith with me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when I had brought them to the land I had sworn
to give them, and they saw all its high hills and leafy trees, there they
offered their sacrifices (there they brought their offensive offerings), there
they sent up appeasing odors, and there they poured out their libations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I asked them: To what sort of high place do you
betake yourselves? - and so they call it a high place even to the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says
the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves like your fathers? Will you lust after
their detestable idols? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By offering your gifts, by making your children
pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols even to this
day. Shall I let myself be consulted by you, house of Israel? As I live! says
the Lord GOD: I swear I will not let myself be consulted by you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What you are thinking of shall never happen:
&quot;We shall be like the nations, like the peoples of foreign lands, serving
wood and stone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As I live, says the Lord GOD, with a mighty
hand and outstretched arm, with poured-out wrath, I swear I will be king over
you! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With a mighty hand and outstretched arm, with
poured-out wrath, I will bring you out from the nations and gather you from the
countries over which you are scattered; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2JC href="__PRS.HTM#$2JC">3</a></sup></font></sup> then I will lead you to the desert of the
peoples, where I will enter into judgment with you face to face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Just as I entered into judgment with your
fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so will I enter into judgment with
you, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will count you with the staff and bring back
but a small number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will separate from you those who have
rebelled and transgressed against me; from the land where they sojourned as
aliens I will bring them out, but they shall not return to the land of Israel.
Thus you shall know that I am the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord
GOD: Come, each one of you, destroy your idols! Then listen to me, and never
again profane my holy name with your gifts and your idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For on my holy mountain, on the mountain height
of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there the whole house of Israel without exception
shall worship me; there I will accept them, and there I will claim your
tributes and the first fruits of your offerings, and all that you dedicate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I
have brought you from among the nations and gathered you out of the countries
over which you were scattered; and by means of you I will manifest my holiness
in the sight of the nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus you shall know that I am the LORD, when I
bring you back to the land of Israel, the land which I swore to give to your
fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There you shall recall your conduct and all the
deeds by which you defiled yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves because
of all the evil things you did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And you shall know that I am the LORD when I
deal with you thus, for my name's sake, and not according to your evil conduct
and corrupt actions, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD. </p>
