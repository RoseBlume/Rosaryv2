<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God wrought swift miracles at his words and
sustained him in the king's presence. He gave him the commandments for his
people, and revealed to him his glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For his trustworthiness and meekness God

him into the cloud, Where, face to face, he gave him the commandments, the law

bestowed on him the priesthood of his people; He established him in honor and
crowned him with lofty majesty; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He clothed him with splendid apparel, and
adorned him with the glorious vestments: Breeches and tunic and robe with
pomegranates around the hem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And a rustle of bells round about, through
whose pleasing sound at each step He would be heard within the sanctuary, and
the children of his race would be remembered; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sacred vestments of gold, of violet, and of
crimson, wrought with embroidery; The breastpiece for decision, the ephod and
cincture </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with scarlet yarn, the work of the weaver;
Precious stones with seal engravings in golden settings, the work of the

splendor, a delight to the eyes, beauty supreme. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Before him, no one was adorned with these, nor
may they ever be worn by any Except his sons and them alone, generation after
generation, for all time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His cereal offering is wholly burnt with the
established sacrifice twice each day; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For Moses ordained him and anointed him with
the holy oil, In a lasting covenant with him and with his family, as permanent
as the heavens, That he should serve God in his priesthood and bless his people
in his name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He chose him from all mankind to offer
holocausts and choice offerings, To burn sacrifices of sweet odor for a
memorial, and to atone for the people of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He gave to him his laws, and authority to
prescribe and to judge: To teach the precepts to his people, and the ritual to
the descendants of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Men of other families were inflamed against
him, were jealous of him in the desert, The followers of Dathan and Abiram, and
the band of Korah in their defiance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the LORD saw this and became angry, he
destroyed them in his burning wrath. He brought down upon them a miracle, and
consumed them with his flaming fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he increased the glory of Aaron and
bestowed upon him his inheritance: The sacred offerings he allotted to him,
with the showbread as his portion; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The oblations of the LORD are his food, a gift
to him and his descendants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he holds no land among the people nor
shares with them their heritage; For the LORD himself is his portion, his
inheritance in the midst of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>PHINEHAS too, the son of Eleazar, was the
courageous third of his line When, zealous for the God of all, he met the crisis
of his people And, at the prompting of his noble heart, atoned for the children
of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore on him again God conferred the right,
in a covenant of friendship, to provide for the sanctuary, So that he and his descendants
should possess the high priesthood forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For even his covenant with David, the son of
Jesse of the tribe of Judah, Was an individual heritage through one son alone;
but the heritage of Aaron is for all his descendants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now bless the LORD who has crowned you with
glory! May he grant you wisdom of heart to govern his people in justice, Lest
their welfare should ever be forgotten, or your authority, throughout all time.
