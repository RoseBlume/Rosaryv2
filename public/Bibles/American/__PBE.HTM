<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 30</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah sent a message to all Israel and
Judah, and even wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh saying that they should
come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover in honor
of the LORD, the God of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king, his princes, and the entire assembly
in Jerusalem had agreed to celebrate the Passover during the second month, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for they could not celebrate it at the time of
the restoration: the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient
numbers, and the people were not gathered at Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this proposal had been approved by the
king and the entire assembly, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they issued a decree to be proclaimed
throughout all Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan, that everyone should come to
Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover in honor of the LORD, the God of Israel;
for not many had kept it in the manner prescribed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly the couriers, with the letters written
by the king and his princes, traversed all Israel and Judah, and at the king's
command they said: &quot;Israelites, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham,
Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you, the remnant left from the hands of
the Assyrian kings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Be not like your fathers and your brethren who
proved faithless to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he delivered
them over to desolation, as you yourselves now see. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Be not obstinate, as your fathers were; extend
your hands to the LORD and come to his sanctuary that he has consecrated
forever, and serve the LORD, your God, that he may turn away his burning anger
from you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For when you return to the LORD, your brethren
and your children will find mercy with their captors and return to this land;
for merciful and compassionate is the LORD, your God, and he will not turn away
his face from you if you return to him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the couriers passed from city to city in the
land of Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as Zebulun, but they were derided and
scoffed at. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh and
Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Judah, however, the power of God brought it
about that the people were of one mind to carry out the command of the king and
the princes in accordance with the word of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus many people gathered in Jerusalem to
celebrate the feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month; it was a very
great assembly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They proceeded to take down the altars that
were in Jerusalem; also they removed all the altars of incense and cast them
into the Kidron Valley. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth
day of the second month. The priests and Levites, touched with shame,
sanctified themselves and brought holocausts into the house of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They stood in the places prescribed for them
according to the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood
given them by the Levites; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for many in the assembly had not sanctified
themselves, and the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover victims
for all who were unclean and therefore could not consecrate them to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The greater part of the people, in fact,
chiefly from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed
themselves. Nevertheless they ate the Passover, contrary to the prescription;
for Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, &quot;May the LORD, who is good, grant
pardon to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>everyone who has resolved to seek God, the
LORD, the God of his fathers, though he be not clean as holiness
requires.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD heard Hezekiah and spared the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the Israelites who were in Jerusalem
celebrated the feast of Unleavened Bread with great rejoicing for seven days,
and the Levites and the priests sang the praises of the LORD day after day with
all their strength. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites
who had shown themselves well skilled in the service of the LORD. And when they
had completed the seven days of festival, slaying peace offerings and singing
praises to the LORD, the God of their fathers, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the whole assembly agreed to celebrate another
seven days. With joy, therefore, they continued the festivity seven days
longer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Hezekiah of Judah had contributed a
thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep to the assembly, and the princes had
contributed to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. The
priests sanctified themselves in great numbers, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the whole assembly of Judah rejoiced,
together with the priests and Levites and the rest of the assembly that had
come from Israel, as well as the sojourners from the land of Israel and those
that lived in Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for since
the days of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like
in the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the levitical priests rose and blessed the
people; their voice was heard and their prayer reached heaven, God's holy
dwelling. </p>
