<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When King David was old and advanced in years,
though they spread covers over him he could not keep warm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servants therefore said to him, &quot;Let a
young virgin be sought to attend you, lord king, and to nurse you. If she
sleeps with your royal majesty, you will be kept warm.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they sought for a beautiful girl throughout
the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunamite, whom they brought to
the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The maiden, who was very beautiful, nursed the
king and cared for him, but the king did not have relations with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Adonijah, son of Haggith, began to display his
ambition to be king. He acquired chariots, drivers, and fifty henchmen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet his father never rebuked him or asked why
he was doing this. Adonijah was also very handsome, and next in age to Absalom
by the same mother. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He conferred with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and
with Abiathar the priest, and they supported him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, Zadok the priest, Benaiah, son of
Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, and Shimei and his companions, the pick of
David's army, did not side with Adonijah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he slaughtered sheep, oxen, and fatlings
at the stone Zoheleth, near En-rogel, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RH href="__P8F.HTM#$RH">1</a></sup></font></sup> Adonijah invited all
his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he did not invite the prophet Nathan, or
Benaiah, or the pick of the army, or his brother Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Nathan said to Bathsheba, Solomon's
mother: &quot;Have you not heard that Adonijah, son of Haggith, has become king
without the knowledge of our lord David? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come now, let me advise you so that you may
save your life and that of your son Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Go, visit King David, and say to him, 'Did you
not, lord king, swear to your handmaid: Your son Solomon shall be king after me
and shall sit upon my throne? Why, then, has Adonijah become king?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And while you are still there speaking to the
king, I will come in after you and confirm what you have said.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Bathsheba visited the king in his room,
while Abishag the Shunamite was attending him because of his advanced age. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bathsheba bowed in homage to the king, who said
to her, &quot;What do you wish?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She answered him: &quot;My lord, you swore to
me your handmaid by the LORD, your God, that my son Solomon should reign after
you and sit upon your throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my
lord king, do not know it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He has slaughtered oxen, fatlings, and sheep in
great numbers; he has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and
Joab, the general of the army, but not your servant Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RI href="__P8F.HTM#$RI">2</a></sup></font></sup> Now, my lord king, all Israel is waiting for
you to make known to them who is to sit on the throne after your royal majesty.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If this is not done, when my lord the king
sleeps with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be considered
criminals.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While she was still speaking to the king, the
prophet Nathan came in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had been announced, the prophet entered
the king's presence and, bowing to the floor, did him homage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Nathan said: &quot;Have you decided, my
lord king, that Adonijah is to reign after you and sit on your throne? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went down today and slaughtered oxen,
fatlings, and sheep in great numbers; he invited all the king's sons, the
commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest, and they are eating and
drinking in his company and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But me, your servant, he did not invite; nor
Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was this done by my royal master's order
without my being told who was to succeed to your majesty's kingly throne?&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King David answered, &quot;Call Bathsheba
here.&quot; When she re-entered the king's presence and stood before him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king swore, &quot;As the LORD lives, who
has delivered me from all distress, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>this very day I will fulfill the oath I swore
to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, that your son Solomon should reign after
me and should sit upon my throne in my place.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bowing to the floor in homage to the king,
Bathsheba said, &quot;May my lord, King David, live forever!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King David summoned Zadok the priest,
Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, son of Jehoiada. When they had entered the
king's presence, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to them: &quot;Take with you the royal
attendants. Mount my son Solomon upon my own mule and escort him down to Gihon.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet
are to anoint him king of Israel, and you shall blow the horn and cry, 'Long
live King Solomon!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you come back in his train, he is to go in
and sit upon my throne and reign in my place. I designate him ruler of Israel
and of Judah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In answer to the king, Benaiah, son of
Jehoiada, said: &quot;So be it! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so
decree! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the LORD has been with your royal majesty,
so may he be with Solomon, and exalt his throne even more than that of my lord,
King David!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RJ href="__P8F.HTM#$RJ">3</a></sup></font></sup> So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,
Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites went down, and
mounting Solomon on King David's mule, escorted him to Gihon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from
the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the horn and all the people shouted,
&quot;Long live King Solomon!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the people went up after him, playing
flutes and rejoicing so much as to split open the earth with their shouting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Adonijah and all the guests who were with him
heard it, just as they ended their banquet. When Joab heard the sound of the
horn, he asked, &quot;What does this uproar in the city mean?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he was speaking, Jonathan, son of Abiathar
the priest, arrived. &quot;Come,&quot; said Adonijah, &quot;you are a man of
worth and must bring good news.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;On the contrary!&quot; Jonathan answered
him. &quot;Our lord, King David, has made Solomon king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan
the prophet, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites, and
they mounted him upon the king's own mule. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet
anointed him king at Gihon, and they went up from there rejoicing, so that the
city is in an uproar. That is the noise you heard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Besides, Solomon took his seat on the royal
throne, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the king's servants went in and paid their
respects to our lord, King David, saying, 'May God make Solomon more famous
than you and exalt his throne more than your own!' And the king in his bed
worshiped God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and this is what he said: 'Blessed be the LORD,
the God of Israel, who has this day seated one of my sons upon my throne, so
that I see it with my own eyes.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the guests of Adonijah left in terror, each
going his own way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RK href="__P8F.HTM#$RK">4</a></sup></font></sup> Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, also left; he
went and seized the horns of the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was reported to Solomon that Adonijah, in
his fear of King Solomon, had seized the horns of the altar and said, &quot;Let
King Solomon first swear that he will not kill me, his servant, with the
sword.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon answered, &quot;If he proves himself
worthy, not a hair shall fall from his head. But if he is found guilty of
crime, he shall die.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon sent to have him brought down from
the altar, and he came and paid homage to the king. Solomon then said to him,
&quot;Go to your home.&quot; </p>
