<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S4 href="__P8Q.HTM#$S4">1</a></sup></font></sup> Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had
come to proclaim him king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who was still in Egypt,
where he had fled from King Solomon, returned from Egypt as soon as he learned
this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to Rehoboam: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Your father put on us a heavy yoke. If
you now lighten the harsh service and the heavy yoke your father imposed on us,
we will serve you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Come back to me in three days,&quot; he
answered them. When the people had departed, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had been
in his father's service while he was alive, and asked, &quot;What answer do you
advise me to give this people?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They replied, &quot;If today you will be the
servant of this people and submit to them, giving them a favorable answer, they
will be your servants forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he ignored the advice the elders had given
him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were in his
service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them, &quot;What answer do you
advise me to give this people, who have asked me to lighten the yoke my father
imposed on them?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The young men who had grown up with him
replied, &quot;This is what you must say to this people who have asked you to
lighten the yoke your father put on them: 'My little finger is thicker than my
father's body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I
will make it heavier. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with
scorpions.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the third day all Israel came back to King
Rehoboam, as he had instructed them to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ignoring the advice the elders had given him,
the king gave the people a harsh answer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them, as the young men had advised:
&quot;My father put on you a heavy yoke, but I will make it heavier. My father
beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king did not listen to the people, for the
LORD brought this about to fulfill the prophecy he had uttered to Jeroboam, son
of Nebat, through Ahijah the Shilonite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S5 href="__P8Q.HTM#$S5">2</a></sup></font></sup> When all Israel saw that the king did not
listen to them, the people answered the king: &quot;What share have we in
David? We have no heritage in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now look
to your own house, David.&quot;So Israel went off to their tents, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites who
lived in the cities of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Rehoboam then sent out Adoram,
superintendent of the forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death.
Rehoboam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Israel went into rebellion against David's
house to this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had
returned, they summoned him to an assembly and made him king over all Israel.
None remained loyal to David's house except the tribe of Judah alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On his arrival in Jersusalem, Rehoboam gathered
together all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin - one hundred and
eighty thousand seasoned warriors - to fight against the house of Israel, to
restore the kingdom to Rehoboam, son of Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, the LORD spoke to Shemaiah, a man of
God: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Say to Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of
Judah, and to the house of Judah and to Benjamin, and to the rest of the
people: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Thus says the LORD: You must not march out to
fight against your brother Israelites. Let every man return home, for I have
brought this about.'&quot; They accepted this message of the LORD and gave up
the expedition accordingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam built up Shechem in the hill country
of Ephraim and lived there. Then he left it and built up Penuel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S6 href="__P8Q.HTM#$S6">3</a></sup></font></sup> Jeroboam thought to himself: &quot;The kingdom
will return to David's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If now this people go up to offer sacrifices in
the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, the hearts of this people will return to
their master, Rehoboam, king of Judah, and they will kill me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After taking counsel, the king made two calves
of gold and said to the people: &quot;You have been going up to Jerusalem long
enough. Here is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of
Egypt.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S7 href="__P8Q.HTM#$S7">4</a></sup></font></sup> And he put one in Bethel, the other in Dan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This led to sin, because the people frequented
these calves in Bethel and in Dan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also built temples on the high places and
made priests from among the people who were not Levites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam established a feast in the eighth
month on the fifteenth day of the month to duplicate in Bethel the pilgrimage
feast of Judah, with sacrifices to the calves he had made; and he stationed in
Bethel priests of the high places he had built. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam ascended the altar he built in Bethel
on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month in which he arbitrarily
chose to establish a feast for the Israelites; he was going to offer sacrifice.

bearers of the invisible Divine Majesty, quickly became occasions for idolatry.
Thus Jeroboam caused Israel to sin, and sealed his doom and that of his royal
