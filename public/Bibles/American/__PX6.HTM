<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He questioned him at length, but he gave him no

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pilate addressed them a third time, &quot;What

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The verdict of Pilate was that their demand
should be granted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he released the man who had been imprisoned
for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them
to deal with as they wished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A large crowd of people followed Jesus,
including many women who mourned and lamented him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus turned to them and said, &quot;Daughters
