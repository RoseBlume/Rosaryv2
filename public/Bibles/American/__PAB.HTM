<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-VL href="__PAB.HTM#$VL">1</a></sup></font></sup> A satan rose up against Israel, and he enticed
David into taking a census of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David therefore said to Joab and to the other
generals of the army, &quot;Go, find out the number of the Israelites from
Beer-sheba to Dan, and report back to me that I may know their number.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Joab replied: &quot;May the LORD increase
his people a hundredfold! My lord king, are not all of them my lord's subjects?
Why does my lord seek to do this thing? Why will he bring guilt upon
Israel?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, the king's command prevailed over
Joab, who departed and traversed all of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab reported the result of the census to
David: of men capable of wielding a sword, there were in all Israel one million
one hundred thousand, and in Judah four hundred and seventy thousand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Levi and Benjamin, however, he did not include
in the census, for the king's command was repugnant to Joab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This command displeased God, who began to
punish Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to God, &quot;I have sinned
greatly in doing this thing. Take away your servant's guilt, for I have acted
very foolishly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, in
these words: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go, tell David: Thus says the LORD: I
offer you three alternatives; choose one of them, and I will inflict it on
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly, Gad went to David and said to him;
&quot;Thus says the LORD: Decide now -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>will it be three years of famine; or three
months of fleeing your enemies, with the sword of your foes ever at your back;
or three days of the LORD'S own sword, a pestilence in the land, with the
LORD'S destroying angel in every part of Israel? Therefore choose: What answer
am I to give him who sent me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to Gad: &quot;I am in dire
straits. But I prefer to fall into the hand of the LORD, whose mercy is very
great, than into the hands of men.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel,
and seventy thousand men of Israel died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God also sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem;
but as he was on the point of destroying it, the LORD saw and decided against
the calamity, and said to the destroying angel, &quot;Enough now! Stay your
hand!&quot;The angel of the LORD was then standing by the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jebusite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David raised his eyes, he saw the angel of
the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with a naked sword in his hand
stretched out against Jerusalem. David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth,
prostrated themselves face to the ground, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and David prayed to God: &quot;Was it not I who
ordered the census of the people? I am the one who sinned, I did this wicked
thing. But these sheep, what have they done? O LORD, my God, strike me and my
father's family, but do not afflict your people with this plague!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to
tell David to go up and erect an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jebusite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David went up at Gad's command, given in the
name of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While Ornan was threshing wheat, he turned
around and saw the king, and his four sons who were with him, without
recognizing them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But as David came on toward him, he looked up
and saw that it was David. Then he left the threshing floor and bowed down
before David, his face to the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to Ornan: &quot;Sell me the ground
of this threshing floor, that I may build on it an altar to the LORD. Sell it
to me at its full price, that the plague may be stayed from the people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Ornan said to David: &quot;Take it as your
own, and let my lord the king do what seems best to him. See, I also give you
the oxen for the holocausts, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat
for the cereal offering. I give it all to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But King David replied to Ornan: &quot;No! I
will buy it from you properly, at its full price. I will not take what is yours
for the LORD, nor offer up holocausts that cost me nothing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-VM href="__PAB.HTM#$VM">2</a></sup></font></sup> So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of
gold for the place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then built an altar there to the LORD,
and offered up holocausts and peace offerings. When he called upon the LORD, he
answered him by sending down fire from heaven upon the altar of holocausts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD gave orders to the angel to
return his sword to its sheath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once David saw that the LORD had heard him on
the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he continued to offer sacrifices
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Dwelling of the LORD, which Moses had built
in the desert, and the altar of holocausts were at that time on the high place
at Gibeon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David could not go there to worship God,
for he was fearful of the sword of the angel of the LORD. </p>

change in the term reflects the changed theological outlook of postexilic
Israel, when evil could no longer be attributed directly to God. At an earlier
period the Hebrew word satan (&quot;adversary,&quot; or, especially in a court
of law, &quot;accuser&quot;), when not used of men, designated an angel who
accused men before God (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PEM.HTM#WISDB.JOB.1.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Job 1:6-12;

2:24) and in the New Testament, satan, or the &quot;devil&quot; (from
the Greek translation of the word), designates an evil spirit who tempts men to
wrongdoing. </p>
