<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 24</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joash was seven years old when he became king, and
he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother, named Zibiah, was from
Beer-sheba. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joash did what was pleasing to the LORD as long
as Jehoiada the priest lived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiada provided him with two wives, and he
became the father of sons and daughters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After some time, Joash decided to restore the
LORD'S temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WV href="__PB8.HTM#$WV">1</a></sup></font></sup> He called together the priests and Levites and
said to them: &quot;Go out to all the cities of Judah and collect money from
all Israel that you may repair the house of your God over the years. You must
hasten this affair.&quot; But the Levites did not hasten. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king summoned Jehoiada, who was in
charge, and said to him: &quot;Why have you not required the Levites to bring
in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the servant of the LORD,
and by the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the wicked Athaliah and her sons had
damaged the house of God and had even turned over to the Baals the dedicated
resources of the LORD'S temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the king's command, therefore, they made a
chest, which they put outside the gate of the LORD'S temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They had it proclaimed throughout Judah and
Jerusalem that the tax which Moses, the servant of God, had imposed on Israel
in the desert should be brought to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the princes and the people rejoiced; they
brought what was asked and cast it into the chest until it was filled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whenever the chest was brought to the royal
officials by the Levites and they saw that it contained much money, the royal
scribe and an overseer for the high priest came, emptied the chest, then took
it back and returned it to its place. This they did day after day until they
had collected a large sum of money. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to the
workmen in charge of the labor on the LORD'S temple, who hired masons and
carpenters to restore the temple, and also iron- and bronze-smiths to repair
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The workmen labored, and the task of
restoration progressed under their hands. They restored the house of God
according to its original form, and reinforced it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After they had finished, they brought the rest
of the money to the king and to Jehoiada, who had it made into utensils for the
LORD'S temple, utensils for the service and the holocausts, and basins and
other gold and silver utensils. They offered holocausts in the LORD'S temple
continually throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiada lived to a ripe old age; he was a
hundred and thirty years old when he died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was buried in the City of David with the
kings, because he had done good in Israel, in particular with respect to God
and his temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the death of Jehoiada, the princes of
Judah came and paid homage to the king, and the king then listened to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They forsook the temple of the LORD, the God of
their fathers, and began to serve the sacred poles and the idols; and because
of this crime of theirs, wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Although prophets were sent to them to convert
them to the LORD, the people would not listen to their warnings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the spirit of God possessed Zechariah, son
of Jehoiada the priest. He took his stand above the people and said to them:
&quot;God says, 'Why are you transgressing the LORD'S commands, so that you
cannot prosper? Because you have abandoned the LORD, he has abandoned
you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they conspired against him, and at the
king's order they stoned him to death in the court of the LORD'S temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus King Joash was unmindful of the devotion
shown him by Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, and slew his son. And as he was
dying, he said, &quot;May the LORD see and avenge.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the turn of the year a force of Arameans came
up against Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem, did away with all the
princes of the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though the Aramean force came with few men, the
LORD surrendered a very large force into their power, because Judah had
abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers. So punishment was meted out to
Joash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the Arameans had departed from him,
leaving him in grievous suffering, his servants conspired against him because
of the murder of the son of Jehoiada the priest. They killed him on his
sickbed. He was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These conspired against him: Zabad, son of
Shimeath from Ammon, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith from Moab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of his sons, and the great tribute imposed on
him, and of his rebuilding of the house of God, there is a written account in
the midrash of the book of the kings. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king. </p>
