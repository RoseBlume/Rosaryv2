<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LS href="__PSN.HTM#$2LS">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the second year of his reign, King
Nebuchadnezzar had a dream which left his spirit no rest and robbed him of his
sleep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LT href="__PSN.HTM#$2LT">2</a></sup></font></sup> So he ordered that the magicians, enchanters,
sorcerers, and Chaldeans be summoned to interpret the dream for him. When they
came and presented themselves to the king, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to them, &quot;I had a dream which will
allow my spirit no rest until I know what it means.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LU href="__PSN.HTM#$2LU">3</a></sup></font></sup> The Chaldeans answered the king (Aramaic):
&quot;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream and we will give its
meaning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king answered the Chaldeans, &quot;This is
what I have decided: unless you tell me the dream and its meaning, you shall be
cut to pieces and your houses destroyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you tell me the dream and its meaning,
you shall receive from me gifts and presents and great honors. Now tell me the
dream and its meaning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again they answered, &quot;Let the king tell
his servants the dream and we will give its meaning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king replied: &quot;I know for certain
that you are bargaining for time, since you know what I have decided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you do not tell me the dream, there can be
but one decree for you. You have framed a false and deceitful interpretation to
present me with till the crisis is past. Tell me the dream, therefore, that I
may be sure that you can also give its correct interpretation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Chaldeans answered the king: &quot;There is
not a man on earth who can do what you ask, O king; never has any king, however
great and mighty, asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What you demand, O king, is too difficult;
there is no one who can tell it to the king except the gods who do not dwell
among men.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this the king became violently angry and
ordered all the wise men of Babylon to be put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the decree was issued that the wise men
should be slain, Daniel and his companions were also sought out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Daniel prudently took counsel with Arioch,
the captain of the king's guard, who had set out to kill the wise men of
Babylon: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;O officer of the king,&quot; he asked,
&quot;what is the reason for this harsh order from the king?&quot; When Arioch
told him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel went and asked for time from the king,
that he might give him the interpretation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel went home and informed his companions
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that they might implore the mercy of the God of
heaven in regard to this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not
perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During the night the mystery was revealed to
Daniel in a vision, and he blessed the God of heaven: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Blessed be the name of God forever and
ever, for wisdom and power are his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He causes the changes of the times and seasons,
makes kings and unmakes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to
those who understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He reveals deep and hidden things and knows
what is in the darkness, for the light dwells with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To you, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and
praise, because you have given me wisdom and power. Now you have shown me what
we asked of you, you have made known to us the king's dream.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had
appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, &quot;Do not put
the wise men of Babylon to death. Bring me before the king, and I will tell him
the interpretation of the dream.&quot; Arioch quickly brought Daniel to the
king and said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I have found a man among the Judean
captives who can give the interpretation to the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king asked Daniel, whose name was
Belteshazzar, &quot;Can you tell me the dream that I had, and its
meaning?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the king's presence Daniel made this reply:
&quot;The mystery about which the king has inquired, the wise men, enchanters,
magicians, and astrologers could not explain to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But there is a God in heaven who reveals
mysteries, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what is to happen in days to
come; this was the dream you saw as you lay in bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To you in your bed there came thoughts about
what should happen in the future, and he who reveals mysteries showed you what
is to be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To me also this mystery has been revealed; not
that I am wiser than any other living person, but in order that its meaning may
be made known to the king, that you may understand the thoughts in your own
mind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;In your vision, O king, you saw a statue,
very large and exceedingly bright, terrifying in appearance as it stood before
you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest
and arms were silver, its belly and thighs bronze, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LV href="__PSN.HTM#$2LV">4</a></sup></font></sup> the legs iron, its feet partly iron and partly
tile. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While you looked at the statue, a stone which
was hewn from a mountain without a hand being put to it, struck its iron and
tile feet, breaking them in pieces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The iron, tile, bronze, silver, and gold all
crumbled at once, fine as the chaff on the threshing floor in summer, and the
wind blew them away without leaving a trace. But the stone that struck the
statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LW href="__PSN.HTM#$2LW">5</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;This was the dream; the interpretation
we shall also give in the king's presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You, O king, are the king of kings; to you the
God of heaven has given dominion and strength, power and glory; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>men, wild beasts, and birds of the air,
wherever they may dwell, he has handed over to you, making you ruler over them
all; you are the head of gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Another kingdom shall take your place, inferior
to yours, then a third kingdom, of bronze, which shall rule over the whole
earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as
iron; it shall break in pieces and subdue all these others, just as iron breaks
in pieces and crushes everything else. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The feet and toes you saw, partly of potter's
tile and partly of iron, mean that it shall be a divided kingdom, but yet have
some of the hardness of iron. As you saw the iron mixed with clay tile, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the toes partly iron and partly tile, the
kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The iron mixed with clay tile means that they
shall seal their alliances by intermarriage, but they shall not stay united,
any more than iron mixes with clay. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the lifetime of those kings the God of
heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed or delivered up to
another people; rather, it shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and put an
end to them, and it shall stand forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That is the meaning of the stone you saw hewn
from the mountain without a hand being put to it, which broke in pieces the
tile, iron, bronze, silver, and gold. The great God has revealed to the king
what shall be in the future; this is exactly what you dreamed, and its meaning
is sure.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell down and
worshiped Daniel and ordered sacrifice and incense offered to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To Daniel the king said, &quot;Truly your God
is the God of gods and Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries; that is why
you were able to reveal this mystery.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He advanced Daniel to a high post, gave him
many generous presents, made him ruler of the whole province of Babylon and chief
prefect over all the wise men of Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At Daniel's request the king made Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego administrators of the province of Babylon, while Daniel
himself remained at the king's court. </p>

kingdoms in this apocalyptic perspective are the Babylonian (gold), the Median
(silver), the Persian (bronze), and the Hellenistic (iron). The last, after
Alexander's death, was divided among his generals (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSN.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.2.41"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel
2:41-42). The two resulting kingdoms, which most affected the Jews,
were the dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt and that of the Seleucids in Syria,
who tried in vain, by war and through intermarriage, to restore the unity of
Alexander's empire (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSN.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.2.43"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 2:43). The stone hewn from
