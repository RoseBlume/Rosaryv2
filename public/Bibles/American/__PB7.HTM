<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the seventh year, Jehoiada took courage and
entered a conspiracy with certain captains: Azariah, son of Jehoram; Ishmael,
son of Jehohanan; Azariah, son of Obed; Masseiah, son of Adaiah; and
Elishaphat, son of Zichri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They journeyed about Judah, gathering the
Levites from all the cities of Judah and also the heads of the Israelite
families. When they had come to Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the whole assembly made a covenant with the
king in the house of God. Jehoiada said to them: &quot;Here is the king's son
who must reign, as the LORD promised concerning the sons of David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is what you must do: a third of your
number, both priests and Levites, who come in on the sabbath must guard the
thresholds, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>another third must be at the king's palace, and
the final third at the Foundation Gate, when all the people will be in the
courts of the LORD'S temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let no one enter the LORD'S house except the
priests and those Levites who are ministering. They may enter because they are
holy; but all the other people must observe the prescriptions of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Levites shall surround the king on all
sides, each with his weapon drawn. Whoever tries to enter the house must be
slain. Stay with the king wherever he goes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Levites and all Judah did just as Jehoiada
the priest commanded. Each brought his men, those who were to come in on the
sabbath as well as those who were to depart on the sabbath, since Jehoiada the
priest had not dismissed any of the divisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoiada the priest gave the captains the
spears, shields and bucklers of King David which were in the house of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He stationed all the people, each with his
spear in hand, from the southern to the northern extremity of the enclosure,
around the altar and the temple on the king's behalf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they brought out the king's son, set the
crown and the insignia upon him, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons
anointed him, and they cried, &quot;Long live the king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Athaliah heard the din of the people
running and acclaiming the king, she went to the people in the temple of the
LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WU href="__PB7.HTM#$WU">1</a></sup></font></sup> She looked, and there was the king standing
beside his pillar at the entrance, the officers and the trumpeters around him,
and all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, while the
singers with their musical instruments were leading the acclaim. Athaliah tore
her garments and cried out, &quot;Treason! treason!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiada the priest sent out the captains
who were in command of the army; he said to them: &quot;Take her outside
through the ranks, and if anyone tries to follow her, let him die by the sword.
For,&quot; the priest continued, &quot;you must not put her to death in the
LORD'S temple.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they seized her, and when she arrived at the
entrance to the Horse Gate of the palace, they put her to death there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself
and all the people and the king, that they should be the LORD'S people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And all the people went to the temple of Baal
and tore it down. They smashed its altars and images, and they slew Mattan, the
priest of Baal, before the altars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiada gave the charge of the LORD'S
temple into the hands of the levitical priests, to whom David had assigned
turns in the temple for offering the holocausts of the LORD, as is written in
the law of Moses, with rejoicing and song, as David had provided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, he stationed guards at the gates of
the LORD'S temple so that no one unclean in any respect might enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he took the captains, the nobles, the
rulers among the people, and all the people of the land, and led the king out
of the LORD'S house. When they had come within the upper gate of the king's
house, they seated the king upon the royal throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people of the land rejoiced and the
city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been put to death by the sword. </p>
