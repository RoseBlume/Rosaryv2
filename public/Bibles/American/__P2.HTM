<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>The Pentateuch</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The
Pentateuch, which consists of the first five books of the Bible (Genesis,
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), enjoys particular prestige among the
Jews as the &quot;Law,&quot; or &quot;Torah,&quot; the concrete expression of
God's will in their regard. It is more than a body of legal doctrine, even
though such material occupies many chapters, for it contains the story of the
formation of the People of God: Abraham and the Patriarchs, Moses and the
oppressed Hebrews in Egypt, the birth of Israel in the Sinai covenant, the
journey to the threshold of the Promised Land, and the &quot;discourses&quot;
of Moses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grandeur of this
historic sweep is the result of a careful and complex joining of several
historic traditions, or sources. These are primarily four: the so-called
Yahwist, Elohist, Priestly and Deuteronomic strands that run through the
Pentateuch. (They are conveniently abbreviated as J, E, P and D.) Each brings
to the Torah its own characteristics, its own theological viewpoint - a rich
variety of interpretation that the sensitive reader will take pains to
appreciate. A superficial difference between two of these sources is
responsible for their names: the Yahwist prefers the name <em>Yahweh</em>
(represented in translation as <em>Lord</em>) by which God revealed himself to
Israel; the Elohist prefers the generic name for God, <em>Elohim</em>. The
Yahwist is concrete, imaginative, using many anthropomorphisms in its
theological approach, as seen, e.g., in the narrative of creation in Genesis 2,
compared with the Priestly version in Genesis 1. The Elohist is more sober,
moralistic. The Priestly strand, which emphasizes genealogies, is more severely
theological in tone. The Deuteronomic approach is characterized by the intense
hortatory style of Deuteronomy 5-11, and by certain principles from which it
works, such as the centralization of worship in the Jerusalem temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, even this analysis
of the Pentateuch is an over-simplification , for it is not always possible to
distinguish with certainty among the various sources. The fact is that each of
these individual traditions incorporates much older material. The Yahwist was
himself a collector and adapter. His narrative is made up of many disparate
stories that have been reoriented, and given a meaning within the context in
which they now stand; e.g., the story of Abraham and Isaac in Gen 22. Within
the J and P traditions one has to reckon with many individual units; these had
their own history and life-setting before they were brought together into the
present more or less connected narrative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not to deny the
role of Moses in the development of the Pentateuch. It is true we do not
conceive of him as the author of the books in the modern sense. But there is no
reason to doubt that, in the events described in these traditions, he had a
uniquely important role, especially as lawgiver. Even the later laws which have
been added in P and D are presented as a Mosaic heritage. Moses is the lawgiver
<em>par excellence</em>, and all later legislation is conceived in his spirit,
and therefore attributed to him. Hence, the reader is not held to undeviating
literalness in interpreting the words, &quot;the LORD said to Moses.&quot; One
must keep in mind that the Pentateuch is the crystallization of Israel's
age-old relationship with God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In presenting the story of
the birth of the People of God, the Pentateuch looks back to the promises made
to the patriarchs, and forward to the continuing fulfillment of these promises
in later books of the Bible. The promises find their classic expression in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PE.HTM#PENT.GEN.12.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
12:1ff. The &quot;God of the Fathers&quot; challenges Abraham to
believe: the patriarch is to receive a people, a land, and through him the
nations will somehow be blessed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mysterious and tortuous
way in which this people is brought into being is described: Despite Sarah's
sterility, Isaac is finally born - to be offered in sacrifice! The promises are
renewed to him eventually , and also to the devious Jacob, as if to show that
the divine design will be effected, with or without human cunning. The
magnificent story of Joseph is highlighted by the theme of Providence; the
promise of a people is taking shape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel is not formed in a
vacuum, but amid the age-old civilization of Mesopotamia and the Nile.
Oppression in Egypt provokes a striking intervention of God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yahweh reveals himself to
Moses as a savior, and the epic story of deliverance is told in Exodus. This
book also tells of the Sinai covenant, which is rightfully regarded as the key
to the Old Testament. Through the covenant Israel becomes Yahweh's people, and
Yahweh becomes Israel's God. This act of grace marks the fulfillment of the
first promise; that Abraham will be the father of a great nation, God's special
possession. The laws in Exodus and Leviticus (P tradition) are both early and
late. They spell out the proper relationship of the federation of the twelve
tribes with the Lord. He is a jealous God, demanding exclusive allegiance; he
cannot be imaged; he takes vengeance upon the wicked, and shows mercy to the good.
Slowly the Lord reveals himself to his people; with remarkable honesty, Israel
records the unsteady response - the murmurings and rebellions and infidelities
through the desert wanderings up to the plain of Moab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This sacred history was
formed within the bosom of early Israel, guided by the spirit of God. It was
sung beside the desert campfires; it was commemorated in the liturgical feasts,
such as Passover; it was transmitted by word of mouth from generation to
generation - until all was brought together in writing, about the sixth century
B.C., when the literary formation of the Pentateuch came to an end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Book of Deuteronomy has
a history quite peculiar to itself. Its old traditions and law code (12-26) are
put forth in the form of &quot;discourses&quot; of Moses before his death. The
extraordinarily intense and hortatory tone fits the mood of a discourse. The
book contains possibly the preaching of the Levites in the northern kingdom of
Israel before its fall in 721 B.C. If this book is situated in its proper
historical perspective, its true impact is more vividly appreciated. It is the
blueprint of the great &quot;Deuteronomic&quot; reform under King Josiah
(640-609 B.C.). This was an attempt to galvanize the people into a wholehearted
commitment to the covenant ideals, into an obedience motivated by the great
commandment of love (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4L.HTM#PENT.DEU.6.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 6:4ff). Israel has yet
another chance, if it obeys. The people are poised between life and death; and
they are exhorted to choose life - today (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P55.HTM#PENT.DEU.26.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut
26:16-19; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P59.HTM#PENT.DEU.30.15"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 30:15-20).</p>
