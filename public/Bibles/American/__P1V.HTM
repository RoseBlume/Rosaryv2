<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 14</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to Moses, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8E href="__P1V.HTM#$8E">1</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Tell the Israelites to turn about and
camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You shall camp in front of
Baal-zephon, just opposite, by the sea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh will then say, 'The Israelites are wandering
about aimlessly in the land. The desert has closed in on them.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus will I make Pharaoh so obstinate that he
will pursue them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army,
and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.&quot; This the Israelites did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When it was reported to the king of Egypt that
the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants changed their minds about them.
&quot;What have we done!&quot; they exclaimed. &quot;Why, we have released
Israel from our service!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Pharaoh made his chariots ready and mustered
his soldiers -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>six hundred first-class chariots and all the
other chariots of Egypt, with warriors on them all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So obstinate had the LORD made Pharaoh that he
pursued the Israelites even while they were marching away in triumph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Egyptians, then, pursued them; Pharaoh's
whole army, his horses, chariots and charioteers, caught up with them as they
lay encamped by the sea, at Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh was already near when the Israelites
looked up and saw that the Egyptians were on the march in pursuit of them. In
great fright they cried out to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And they complained to Moses, &quot;Were there
no burial places in Egypt that you had to bring us out here to die in the
desert? Why did you do this to us? Why did you bring us out of Egypt? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Did we not tell you this in Egypt, when we
said, 'Leave us alone. Let us serve the Egyptians'? Far better for us to be the
slaves of the Egyptians than to die in the desert.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Moses answered the people, &quot;Fear not!
Stand your ground, and you will see the victory the LORD will win for you
today. These Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD himself will fight for you; you have
only to keep still.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Why are you
crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And you, lift up your staff and, with hand
outstretched over the sea, split the sea in two, that the Israelites may pass
through it on dry land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that
they will go in after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all
his army, his chariots and charioteers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD,
when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The angel of God, who had been leading Israel's
camp, now moved and went around behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving
the front, took up its place behind them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-8F href="__P1V.HTM#$8F">2</a></sup></font></sup> so that it came between the camp of the
Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night
passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so
turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Israelites marched into the midst of the
sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Egyptians followed in pursuit; all
Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the
midst of the sea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the night watch just before dawn the LORD
cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a glance
that threw it into a panic; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he so clogged their chariot wheels that
they could hardly drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before
Israel, because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD told Moses, &quot;Stretch out
your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians, upon
their chariots and their charioteers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing
head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the water flowed back, it covered the
chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the
Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Israelites had marched on dry land
through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to
their left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the
power of the Egyptians. When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the
seashore </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and beheld the great power that the LORD had
shown against the Egyptians, they feared the LORD and believed in him and in
his servant Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>
