precursor of Jesus (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:27); John is the

coming of the day of the Lord.</p>

pardoning of the sinful woman Luke presents two different reactions to the
ministry of Jesus. A Pharisee, suspecting Jesus to be a prophet, invites Jesus
to a festive banquet in his house, but the Pharisee's self-righteousness leads
to little forgiveness by God and consequently little love shown toward Jesus.
The sinful woman, on the other hand, manifests a faith in God
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.50"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:50) that has led her to seek forgiveness
for her sins, and because so much was forgiven, she now overwhelms Jesus with
her display of love; cf the similar contrast in attitudes in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX1.HTM#GOSP.LUK.18.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
18:9-14. The whole episode is a powerful lesson on the relation
between forgiveness and love.</p>

posture of guests at a banquet. Other oriental banquet customs alluded to in
this story include the reception by the host with a kiss
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.45"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:45), washing the feet of the guests
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.44"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:44), and the anointing of the guests'
heads (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.46"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:46).</p>

forgiven; hence, she has shown great love: literally, &quot;her many sins have
been forgiven, seeing that she has loved much.&quot; That the woman's sins have
been forgiven is attested by the great love she shows toward Jesus. Her love is
the consequence of her forgiveness. This is also the meaning demanded by the
parable in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWQ.HTM#GOSP.LUK.7.41"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 7:41-43.</p>
