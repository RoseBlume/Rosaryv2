<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Preface to the New
American Bible</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On
September 30, 1943, His Holiness
Pope Pius XII issued his now famous encyclical on scripture studies, <em>Divino
afflante Spiritu</em>. He wrote: &quot;We ought to explain the original text
which was written by the inspired author himself and has more authority and
greater weight than any, even the very best, translation whether ancient or
modern. This can be done all the more easily and fruitfully if to the knowledge
of languages be joined a real skill in literary criticism of the same
text.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early in 1944, in
conformity with the spirit of the encyclical, and with the encouragement of
Archbishop Cicognani, Apostolic Delegate to the United States, the Bishops'
Committee of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine requested members of The
Catholic Biblical Association of America to translate the sacred scriptures
from the original languages or from the oldest extant form of the text, and to
present the sense of the biblical text in as correct a form as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first English Catholic
version of the Bible, the Douay-Rheims (1582-1609/10), and its revision by
Bishop Challoner (1750) were based on the Latin Vulgate. In view of the
relative certainties more recently attained by textual and higher criticism, it
has become increasingly desirable that contemporary translations of the sacred
books into English be prepared in which due reverence for the text and strict
observance of the rules of criticism would be combined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The New American Bible</em> has accomplished this in response
to the need of the church in America
today. It is the achievement of some fifty biblical scholars, the greater
number of whom, though not all, are Catholics. In particular, the
editors-in-chief have devoted twenty-five years to this work. The collaboration
of scholars who are not Catholic fulfills the directive of the Second Vatican
Council, not only that &quot;correct translations be made into different
languages especially from the original texts of the sacred books,&quot; but
that, &quot;with the approval of the church authority, these translations be
produced in cooperation with separated brothers&quot; so that &quot;all
Christians may be able to use them.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The text of the books
contained in <em>The New American Bible</em> is a completely new translation
throughout. From the original and the oldest available texts of the sacred
books, it aims to convey as directly as possible the thought and individual
style of the inspired writers. The better understanding of Hebrew and Greek,
and the steady development of the science of textual criticism, the fruit of
patient study since the time of St. Jerome,
have allowed the translators and editors in their use of all available
materials to approach more closely than ever before the sense of what the
sacred authors actually wrote.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where the translation
supposes the received text - Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek, as the case may be -
ordinarily contained in the best-known editions, as the original or the oldest
extant form, no additional remarks are necessary. But for those who are happily
able to study the original text of the scriptures at firsthand, a supplementary
series of textual notes pertaining to the Old Testament was added originally in
an appendix to the typical edition. (It is now obtainable in a separate booklet
from The Catholic Biblical Association of America, The Catholic University of
America, Washington, DC 20064.) These notes furnish a guide in those cases in
which the editorial board judges that the manuscripts in the original
languages, or the evidence of the ancient versions, or some similar source,
furnish the correct reading of a passage, or at least a reading more true to
the original than that customarily printed in the available editions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Massoretic text of 1
and 2 Samuel has in numerous instances been corrected by the more ancient
manuscripts Samuel a, b, and c from Cave 4 of Qumran, with the aid of important
evidence from the Septuagint in both its oldest form and its Lucianic
recension. Fragments of the lost Book of Tobit in Aramaic and in Hebrew,
recovered from Cave 4 of Qumran, are in substantial agreement with the
Sinaiticus Greek recension used for the translation of this book. The lost
original Hebrew text of 1 Maccabees is replaced by its oldest extant form in
Greek. Judith, 2 Maccabees, and parts of Esther are also translated from the
Greek.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The basic text for the
Psalms is not the Massoretic but one which the editors considered closer to the
original inspired form, namely the Hebrew text underlying the new Latin Psalter
of the Church, the <em>Liber Psalmorum</em> (1944,<sup>1</sup> 1945<sup>2</sup>
). Nevertheless they retained full liberty to establish the reading of the
original text on sound critical principles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The translation of Sirach,
based on the original Hebrew as far as it is preserved and corrected from the
ancient versions, is often interpreted in the light of the traditional Greek
text. In the Book of Baruch the basic text is the Greek of the Septuagint, with
some readings derived from an underlying Hebrew form no longer extant. In the
deuterocanonical sections of Daniel (3:24-91, chapter 13 and chapter 14 [these
are Azariah, Susanna and Bel and the Dragon respectively in WORDsearch]), the
basic text is the Greek text of Theodotion, occasionally revised according to
the Greek text of the Septuagint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some instances in the
Book of Job, in Proverbs, Sirach, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Amos, Micah,
Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zechariah there is good reason to believe that the
original order of lines was accidentally disturbed in the transmission of the
text. The verse numbers given in such cases are always those of the current
Hebrew text, though the arrangement differs. In these instances the textual
notes advise the reader of the difficulty. Cases of exceptional dislocation are
called to the reader's attention by footnotes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Books of <em>Genesis to
Ruth</em> were first published in 1952; the Wisdom Books, <em>Job to Sirach</em>,
in 1955; the Prophetic Books, <em>Isaiah to Malachi</em>, in 1961; and the
Historical Books, <em>Samuel to Maccabees</em>, in 1969. In the present edition
of <em>Genesis to Ruth</em> there are certain new features: a general
introduction to the Pentateuch, a retranslation of the text of Genesis with an
introduction, cross-references, and revised textual notes, besides new and
expanded exegetical notes which take into consideration the various sources or
literary traditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The revision of <em>Job to
Sirach</em> includes changes in strophe division in Job and Proverbs and in
titles of principal parts and sections of Wisdom and Ecclesiastes. Corrections
in the text of Sirach are made in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PN5.HTM#WISDB.SIR.39.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach
39:27-35; 40; 41; 42; 43; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNA.HTM#WISDB.SIR.44.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 44:1-17 on the
basis of the Masada text, and in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNH.HTM#WISDB.SIR.51.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach 51:13-30
on the basis of the occurrence of this canticle in the Psalms scroll from
Qumran Cave 11. In this typical edition, new corrections are reflected in the
textual notes of Job, Proverbs, Wisdom, and Sirach. In the Psalms, the
enumeration found in the Hebrew text is followed instead of the double
enumeration, according to both the Hebrew and the Latin Vulgate texts,
contained in the previous edition of this book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Prophetic Books <em>Isaiah
to Malachi</em>, only minor revisions have been made in the structure and
wording of the texts, and in the textual notes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spelling of proper
names in <em>The New American Bible</em> follows the customary forms found in
most English Bibles since the Authorized Version.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The work of translating the
Bible has been characterized as &quot;the sacred and apostolic work of
interpreting the word of God and of presenting it to the laity in translations
as clear as the difficulty of the matter and the limitations of human knowledge
permit&quot; (A. G. Cicognani, Apostolic Delegate, in <em>The Catholic Biblical
Quarterly</em>, 6, [1944], 389-90). In the appraisal of the present work, it is
hoped that the words of the encyclical <em>Divino afflante Spiritu</em> will
serve as a guide: &quot;Let all the sons of the church bear in mind that the
efforts of these resolute laborers in the vineyard of the Lord should be judged
not only with equity and justice but also with the greatest charity; all
moreover should abhor that intemperate zeal which imagines that whatever is new
should for that very reason be opposed or suspected.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conscious of their personal
limitations for the task thus defined, those who have prepared this text cannot
expect that it will be considered perfect; but they can hope that it may deepen
in its readers &quot;the right understanding of the divinely given
Scriptures,&quot; and awaken in them &quot;that piety by which it behooves us
to be grateful to the God of all providence, who from the throne of his majesty
has sent these books as so many personal letters to his own children&quot; (<em>Divino
afflante Spiritu</em>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>The
Pentateuch</i></b></p>

<p>The Pentateuch, which
consists of the first five books of the Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomy), enjoys particular prestige among the Jews as the
&quot;Law,&quot; or &quot;Torah,&quot; the concrete expression of God's will in
their regard. It is more than a body of legal doctrine, even though such
material occupies many chapters, for it contains the story of the formation of
the People of God: Abraham and the Patriarchs, Moses and the oppressed Hebrews
in Egypt, the birth of Israel in the Sinai covenant, the journey to the
threshold of the Promised Land, and the &quot;discourses&quot; of Moses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grandeur of this
historic sweep is the result of a careful and complex joining of several
historic traditions, or sources. These are primarily four: the so-called
Yahwist, Elohist, Priestly and Deuteronomic strands that run through the
Pentateuch. (They are conveniently abbreviated as J, E, P and D.) Each brings to
the Torah its own characteristics, its own theological viewpoint - a rich
variety of interpretation that the sensitive reader will take pains to
appreciate. A superficial difference between two of these sources is
responsible for their names: the Yahwist prefers the name <em>Yahweh</em>
(represented in translation as <em>Lord</em>) by which God revealed himself to
Israel; the Elohist prefers the generic name for God, <em>Elohim</em>. The
Yahwist is concrete, imaginative, using many anthropomorphisms in its
theological approach, as seen, e.g., in the narrative of creation in Genesis 2,
compared with the Priestly version in Genesis 1. The Elohist is more sober,
moralistic. The Priestly strand, which emphasizes genealogies, is more severely
theological in tone. The Deuteronomic approach is characterized by the intense
hortatory style of Deuteronomy 5-11, and by certain principles from which it
works, such as the centralization of worship in the Jerusalem temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, even this analysis
of the Pentateuch is an over-simplification , for it is not always possible to
distinguish with certainty among the various sources. The fact is that each of
these individual traditions incorporates much older material. The Yahwist was
himself a collector and adapter. His narrative is made up of many disparate
stories that have been reoriented, and given a meaning within the context in
which they now stand; e.g., the story of Abraham and Isaac in Gen 22. Within
the J and P traditions one has to reckon with many individual units; these had
their own history and life-setting before they were brought together into the
present more or less connected narrative.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not to deny the
role of Moses in the development of the Pentateuch. It is true we do not
conceive of him as the author of the books in the modern sense. But there is no
reason to doubt that, in the events described in these traditions, he had a
uniquely important role, especially as lawgiver. Even the later laws which have
been added in P and D are presented as a Mosaic heritage. Moses is the lawgiver
<em>par excellence</em>, and all later legislation is conceived in his spirit,
and therefore attributed to him. Hence, the reader is not held to undeviating
literalness in interpreting the words, &quot;the LORD said to Moses.&quot; One
must keep in mind that the Pentateuch is the crystallization of Israel's
age-old relationship with God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In presenting the story of
the birth of the People of God, the Pentateuch looks back to the promises made
to the patriarchs, and forward to the continuing fulfillment of these promises
in later books of the Bible. The promises find their classic expression in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PE.HTM#PENT.GEN.12.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 12:1ff. The &quot;God of the Fathers&quot;
challenges Abraham to believe: the patriarch is to receive a people, a land,
and through him the nations will somehow be blessed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mysterious and tortuous
way in which this people is brought into being is described: Despite Sarah's
sterility, Isaac is finally born - to be offered in sacrifice! The promises are
renewed to him eventually , and also to the devious Jacob, as if to show that
the divine design will be effected, with or without human cunning. The
magnificent story of Joseph is highlighted by the theme of Providence; the
promise of a people is taking shape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Israel is not formed in a
vacuum, but amid the age-old civilization of Mesopotamia and the Nile.
Oppression in Egypt provokes a striking intervention of God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yahweh reveals himself to
Moses as a savior, and the epic story of deliverance is told in Exodus. This
book also tells of the Sinai covenant, which is rightfully regarded as the key
to the Old Testament. Through the covenant Israel becomes Yahweh's people, and
Yahweh becomes Israel's God. This act of grace marks the fulfillment of the
first promise; that Abraham will be the father of a great nation, God's special
possession. The laws in Exodus and Leviticus (P tradition) are both early and
late. They spell out the proper relationship of the federation of the twelve
tribes with the Lord. He is a jealous God, demanding exclusive allegiance; he
cannot be imaged; he takes vengeance upon the wicked, and shows mercy to the
good. Slowly the Lord reveals himself to his people; with remarkable honesty,
Israel records the unsteady response - the murmurings and rebellions and
infidelities through the desert wanderings up to the plain of Moab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This sacred history was
formed within the bosom of early Israel, guided by the spirit of God. It was
sung beside the desert campfires; it was commemorated in the liturgical feasts,
such as Passover; it was transmitted by word of mouth from generation to
generation - until all was brought together in writing, about the sixth century
B.C., when the literary formation of the Pentateuch came to an end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Book of Deuteronomy has
a history quite peculiar to itself. Its old traditions and law code (12-26) are
put forth in the form of &quot;discourses&quot; of Moses before his death. The
extraordinarily intense and hortatory tone fits the mood of a discourse. The
book contains possibly the preaching of the Levites in the northern kingdom of
Israel before its fall in 721 B.C. If this book is situated in its proper
historical perspective, its true impact is more vividly appreciated. It is the
blueprint of the great &quot;Deuteronomic&quot; reform under King Josiah
(640-609 B.C.). This was an attempt to galvanize the people into a wholehearted
commitment to the covenant ideals, into an obedience motivated by the great
commandment of love (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4L.HTM#PENT.DEU.6.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 6:4ff). Israel has yet
another chance, if it obeys. The people are poised between life and death; and
they are exhorted to choose life - today (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P55.HTM#PENT.DEU.26.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut
26:16-19; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P59.HTM#PENT.DEU.30.15"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 30:15-20). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i>The
Book of Genesis</i></b></p>

<p>Genesis, the first book of
the Bible, opens with the Hebrew word bereshit, which means &quot;in the
beginning.&quot; The title &quot;Genesis&quot; was given to the Septuagint
(Greek) translation of the book because of its concern with the origin of the
world (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P3.HTM#PENT.GEN.1.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 1:1; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4.HTM#PENT.GEN.2.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2:4),
of the human race, and, in particular, of the Hebrew people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eleven structural units
(toledoth), of unequal length and importance, present the unity and purpose of
the book in terms of God's universal sovereignty, his dealings with men, and
his choice and formation of a special people to be the instrument of his plan
of salvation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tracing of the direct
descendance from Adam to Jacob constitutes the major part of the book, while
the genealogical tables of lateral branches are not so developed nor of such
interest as those that pertain to the story of the Israelite people. In fact,
these lateral branches gradually disappear from the narrative. And with the
introduction of Abraham and his covenant with God, the history of humanity as such
becomes contracted to the story of the descendants of Abraham through Isaac and
Jacob - the chosen people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite its unity of plan
and purpose, the book is a complex work, not to be attributed to a single
original author. Several sources, or literary traditions, that the final
redactor used in his composition are discernable. These are the Yahwist (J),
Elohist (E) and Priestly (P) sources, which in turn reflect older oral
traditions (see Introduction to the Pentateuch).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Genesis, the Yahwist source
is the most important by reason of its teaching, its antiquity, and the
continuity it gives the book. It constitutes a sacred history, continually
drawing attention to the working out of God's design through his interventions
in the affairs of men. The Elohist source, less well preserved, is found in
fragmentary form only, depicting God's manifestations through visions and
dreams rather than theophanies. Angels are God's intermediaries with men.
Moreover, there is a solicitude for the divine transcendence and greater
sensitivity toward the moral order. The Priestly source contains those
elements-chronological data, lists, genealogies-that construct the framework of
Genesis and bind its contents together. To the J and E sources it adds such
legal institutions as the sabbath rest, circumcision, and the alliances between
God and Noah and God and Abraham.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interpreter of Genesis
will recognize at once the distinct object that sets Gen 1-11 apart: the
recounting of the origin of the world and of man (primeval history). To make
the truths contained in these chapters intelligible to the Israelite people
destined to preserve them, they needed to be expressed through elements
prevailing among that people at that time. For this reason, the truths
themselves must therefore be clearly distinguished from their literary garb.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the story of the
patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PD.HTM#PENT.GEN.11.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
11:27-<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P1G.HTM#PENT.GEN.50.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 50:26), the character of the
narrative changes. While we do not view the account of the patriarchs as
history in the strict sense, nevertheless certain of the matters recounted from
the time of Abraham onward can be placed in the actual historical and social
framework of the Near East in the early part of the second millennium B.C.
(2000-1500), and documented by non-biblical sources.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Genesis contains many
religious teachings of basic importance: the preexistence and transcendence of
God, his wisdom and goodness, his power through which all things are made and on
which they all depend; the special creation of man in God's image and likeness,
and of woman from the substance of man; the institution of marriage as the
union of one man with one woman; man's original state of innocence; man's sin
of pride and disobedience; its consequences for the protoparents and their
posterity. Despite the severity of their punishment, hope of reconciliation is
offered by God through the first as well as the subsequent promises of
salvation and blessing. Abraham is blessed for his faith and obedience, and he
is to be a blessing for all nations through his offspring, Isaac, Jacob, and
Jacob's sons (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PE.HTM#PENT.GEN.12.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 12:3;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PK.HTM#PENT.GEN.18.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 18:18; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PO.HTM#PENT.GEN.22.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 22:18), of
whom the Messiah, mankind's greatest blessing, will eventually be born
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P103.HTM#NTLET.GAL.3.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal 3:8).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frequent references to
Genesis are found in the New Testament. Christ becomes the antithesis of Adam:
sin and death come to mankind through Adam, justification and life through
Jesus Christ (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYT.HTM#NTLET.ROM.5.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Romans 5:12,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYT.HTM#NTLET.ROM.5.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 17-19). Noah's ark becomes the symbol of the
Church, by which men are saved from destruction through the waters of baptism
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P123.HTM#CATHL.1PET.3.20"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Peter 3:20-22); Abraham's faith is the model
for all believers; the sacrifice of his son Isaac typifies the sacrifice of
Christ, Son of the Father. The Liturgy, too, relates the persons of Abel,
Abraham and Melchizedek to Christ in his act of sacrifice.</p>
