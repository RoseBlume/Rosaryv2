<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that
her son was dead, she began to kill off the whole royal family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TC href="__P9B.HTM#$TC">1</a></sup></font></sup> But Jehosheba, daughter of King Jehoram and sister
of Ahaziah, took Joash, his son, and spirited him away, along with his nurse,
from the bedroom where the princes were about to be slain. She concealed him
from Athaliah, and so he did not die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For six years he remained hidden in the temple
of the LORD, while Athaliah ruled the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But in the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned the
captains of the Carians and of the guards. He had them come to him in the
temple of the LORD, exacted from them a sworn commitment, and then showed them
the king's son. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He gave them these orders: &quot;This is what
you must do: the third of you who come on duty on the sabbath shall guard the
king's palace; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>another third shall be at the gate Sur; and the
last third shall be at the gate behind the guards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The two of your divisions who are going off
duty that week shall keep guard over the temple of the LORD for the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall surround the king, each with drawn weapons,
and if anyone tries to approach the cordon, kill him; stay with the king,
whatever he may do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The captains did just as Jehoiada the priest
commanded. Each one with his men, both those going on duty for the sabbath and
those going off duty that week, came to Jehoiada the priest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He gave the captains King David's spears and
shields, which were in the temple of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the guards, with drawn weapons, lined up
from the southern to the northern limit of the enclosure, surrounding the altar
and the temple on the king's behalf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiada led out the king's son and put
the crown and the insignia upon him. They proclaimed him king and anointed him,
clapping their hands and shouting, &quot;Long live the king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Athaliah heard the noise made by the people,
and appeared before them in the temple of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TD href="__P9B.HTM#$TD">2</a></sup></font></sup> When she saw the king standing by the pillar, as
was the custom, and the captains and trumpeters near him, with all the people
of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, she tore her garments and cried
out, &quot;Treason, treason!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiada the priest instructed the
captains in command of the force: &quot;Bring her outside through the ranks. If
anyone follows her,&quot; he added, &quot;let him die by the sword.&quot; He
had given orders that she should not be slain in the temple of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She was led out forcibly to the horse gate of
the royal palace, where she was put to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD
as one party and the king and the people as the other, by which they would be
the LORD'S people; and another covenant, between the king and the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon all the people of the land went to
the temple of Baal and demolished it. They shattered its altars and images
completely, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. After
appointing a detachment for the temple of the LORD, Jehoiada </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with the captains, the Carians, the guards, and
all the people of the land, led the king down from the temple of the LORD
through the guards' gate to the palace, where Joash took his seat on the royal
throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the people of the land rejoiced and the
city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the royal
palace. </p>
