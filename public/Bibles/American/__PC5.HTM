<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Y8 href="__PC5.HTM#$Y8">1</a></sup></font></sup> On the twenty-fourth day of this month, the
Israelites gathered together fasting and in sackcloth, their heads covered with
dust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those of Israelite descent separated themselves
from all who were of foreign extraction, then stood forward and confessed their
sins and the guilty deeds of their fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had taken their places, they read
from the book of the law of the LORD their God, for a fourth part of the day,
and during another fourth part they made their confession and prostrated
themselves before the LORD their God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Standing on the platform of the Levites were
Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, who
cried out to the LORD their God, with a loud voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Levites Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah,
Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, &quot;Arise, bless the LORD,
your God, from eternity to eternity!&quot; The Israelites answered with the
blessing, &quot;Blessed is your glorious name, and exalted above all blessing
and praise.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Y9 href="__PC5.HTM#$Y9">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then Ezra said: &quot;It is you, O LORD, you
are the only one; you made the heavens, the highest heavens and all their host,
the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them. To all of
them you give life, and the heavenly hosts bow down before you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You, O LORD, are the God who chose Abram,
who brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees, and named him Abraham. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you had found his heart faithful in your
sight, you made the covenant with him to give to him and his posterity the land
of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites.
These promises of yours you fulfilled, for you are just. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You saw the affliction of our fathers in
Egypt, you heard their cry by the Red Sea; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You worked signs and wonders against Pharaoh,
against all his servants and the people of his land, Because you knew of their
insolence toward them; thus you made for yourself a name even to this day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sea you divided before them, on dry ground
they passed through the midst of the sea; Their pursuers you hurled into the
depths, like a stone into the mighty waters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With a column of cloud you led them by day, and
by night with a column of fire, To light the way of their journey, the way in
which they must travel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On Mount Sinai you came down, you spoke with
them from heaven; You gave them just ordinances, firm laws, good statutes, and
commandments; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your holy sabbath you made known to them,
commandments, statutes, and law you prescribed for them, by the hand of Moses
your servant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Food from heaven you gave them in their hunger,
water from a rock you sent them in their thirst. You bade them enter and occupy
the land which you had sworn with upraised hand to give them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But they, our fathers, proved to be
insolent; they held their necks stiff and would not obey your commandments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They refused to obey and no longer remembered
the miracles you had worked for them. They stiffened their necks and turned
their heads to return to their slavery in Egypt. But you are a God of pardons,
gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in mercy; you did not
forsake them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though they made for themselves a molten calf,
and proclaimed, 'Here is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and were
guilty of great effronteries, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>yet in your great mercy you did not forsake
them in the desert. The column of cloud did not cease to lead them by day on
their journey, nor did the column of fire by night cease to light for them the
way by which they were to travel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Your good spirit you bestowed on them, to
give them understanding; your manna you did not withhold from their mouths, and
you gave them water in their thirst. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Forty years in the desert you sustained them:
they did not want; their garments did not become worn, and their feet did not
become swollen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you
divided up among them as border lands. They possessed the land of Sihon, king
of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You made their children as numerous as
the stars of the heavens, and you brought them into the land which you had
commanded their fathers to enter and possess. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sons went in to take possession of the
land, and you humbled before them the Canaanite inhabitants of the land and
delivered them over into their power, their kings as well as the peoples of the
land, to do with them as they would. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They captured fortified cities and fertile
land; they took possession of houses filled with all good things, cisterns
already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. They could
eat and have their fill, fatten and feast themselves on your immense good
gifts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But they were contemptuous and
rebellious: they cast your law behind their backs, they slew your prophets who
bore witness against them in order to bring them back to you, and they were
guilty of great effronteries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore you delivered them into the power of
their enemies, who oppressed them. But in the time of their oppression they
would cry out to you, and you would hear them from heaven, and according to
your great mercy give them saviors to deliver them from the power of their
enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;As soon as they had relief, they would go
back to doing evil in your sight. Then again you abandoned them to the power of
their enemies, who crushed them. Then they cried out to you, and you heard them
from heaven and delivered them according to your mercy, many times over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You bore witness against them, in order to
bring them back to your law. But they were insolent and would not obey your
commandments; they sinned against your ordinances, from which men draw life
when they practice them. They turned stubborn backs, stiffened their necks, and
would not obey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You were patient with them for many years,
bearing witness against them through your spirit, by means of your prophets;
still they would not listen. Thus you delivered them over into the power of the
peoples of the lands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet in your great mercy you did not completely
destroy them and you did not forsake them, for you are a kind and merciful God.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now, therefore, O our God, great, mighty,
and awesome God, you who in your mercy preserve the covenant, take into account
all the disasters that have befallen us, our kings, our princes, our priests,
our prophets, our fathers, and your entire people, from the time of the kings
of Assyria until this day! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In all that has come upon us you have been
just, for you kept faith while we have done evil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yes, our kings, our princes, our priests, and
our fathers have not kept your law; they paid no attention to your commandments
and the obligations of which you reminded them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While they were yet in their kingdom, in the
midst of the many good things that you had given them and in the wide and
fertile land that you had spread out before them, they did not serve you nor
did they turn away from their evil deeds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But, see, we today are slaves; and as for the
land which you gave our fathers that they might eat its fruits and good things
- see, we have become slaves upon it! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Its rich produce goes to the kings whom you set
over us because of our sins, who rule over our bodies and our cattle as they
please. We are in great distress!&quot; </p>
