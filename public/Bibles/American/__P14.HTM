</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5Q href="__P14.HTM#$5Q">1</a></sup></font></sup> About that time Judah parted from his brothers
and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite named Hirah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There he met the daughter of a Canaanite named
Shua, married her, and had relations with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She conceived and bore a son, whom she named
Er. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again she conceived and bore a son, whom she
named Onan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5R href="__P14.HTM#$5R">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then she bore still another son, whom she
named Shelah. They were in Chezib when he was born. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah got a wife named Tamar for his
first-born, Er. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Er, Judah's first-born, greatly offended
the LORD; so the LORD took his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5S href="__P14.HTM#$5S">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then Judah said to Onan, &quot;Unite with your
brother's widow, in fulfillment of your duty as brother-in-law, and thus
preserve your brother's line.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Onan, however, knew that the descendants would
not be counted as his; so whenever he had relations with his brother's widow,
he wasted his seed on the ground, to avoid contributing offspring for his
brother. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What he did greatly offended the LORD, and the
LORD took his life too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Judah said to his daughter-in-law
Tamar, &quot;Stay as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows
up&quot; - for he feared that Shelah also might die like his brothers. So Tamar
went to live in her father's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Years passed, and Judah's wife, the daughter of
Shua, died. After Judah completed the period of mourning, he went up to Timnah
for the shearing of his sheep, in company with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Tamar was told that her father-in-law was
on his way up to Timnah to shear his sheep, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>she took off her widow's garb, veiled her face
by covering herself with a shawl, and sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which
is on the way to Timnah; for she was aware that, although Shelah was now grown
up, she had not been given to him in marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Judah saw her, he mistook her for a
harlot, since she had covered her face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went over to her at the roadside, and not
realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he said, &quot;Come, let me have
intercourse with you.&quot; She replied, &quot;What will you pay me for letting
you have intercourse with me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He answered, &quot;I will send you a kid from
the flock.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; she said, &quot;provided you leave a
pledge until you send it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5T href="__P14.HTM#$5T">4</a></sup></font></sup> Judah asked, &quot;What pledge am I to give to
you?&quot; She answered, &quot;Your seal and cord, and the staff you
carry.&quot; So he gave them to her and had intercourse with her, and she
conceived by him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When she went away, she took off her shawl and
put on her widow's garb again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite
to recover the pledge from the woman; but he could not find her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5U href="__P14.HTM#$5U">5</a></sup></font></sup> So he asked the men of the place, &quot;Where
is the temple prostitute, the one by the roadside in Enaim?&quot; But they answered,
&quot;There has never been a temple prostitute here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went back to Judah and told him, &quot;I
could not find her; and besides, the men of the place said there was no temple
prostitute there.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Let her keep the things,&quot; Judah
replied; &quot;otherwise we shall become a laughingstock. After all, I did send
her the kid, even though you were unable to find her.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About three months later, Judah was told that
his daughter-in-law Tamar had played the harlot and was then with child from
her harlotry. &quot;Bring her out,&quot; cried Judah; &quot;she shall be
burned.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But as they were bringing her out, she sent
word to her father-in-law, &quot;It is by the man to whom these things belong
that I am with child. Please verify,&quot; she added, &quot;whose seal and cord
and whose staff these are.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah recognized them and said, &quot;She is
more in the right than I am, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.&quot;
But he had no further relations with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the time of her delivery came, she was
found to have twins in her womb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While she was giving birth, one infant put out
his hand; and the midwife, taking a crimson thread, tied it on his hand, to
note that this one came out first. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5V href="__P14.HTM#$5V">6</a></sup></font></sup> But as he withdrew his hand, his brother came
out; and she said, &quot;What a breach you have made for yourself!&quot; So he
was called Perez. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5W href="__P14.HTM#$5W">7</a></sup></font></sup> Afterward his brother came out; he was called
Zerah.</p>

Yahwist source, has nothing to do with the Joseph story in which Judah is still
living with his father and brothers. The sacred author inserted this independent
account from the life of Judah at this place to mark the long lapse of time
during which Joseph's family knew nothing of his life in Egypt. This is
apparently a personalized history of the early days of the tribe of Judah,
which interbred with several Canaanite clans, though some of these soon became
extinct.</p>
