thereby unclean. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Such is his uncleanness from this flow that it
makes no difference whether the flow drains off or is blocked up; his
uncleanness remains. </p>

he shall give them to the priest, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>
