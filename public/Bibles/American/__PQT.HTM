<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the LORD: See! I rouse against Babylon,
and against those who live in Chaldea, a destroying wind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Against Babylon I will send winnowers to winnow
her and lay waste her land; They shall besiege her from all sides on the day of
affliction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let the bowman draw his bow, and flaunt his
coat of mail; Spare not her young men, doom her entire army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The slain shall fall in the land of Chaldea,
the transfixed, in her streets; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For Israel and Judah are not widowed of their
God, the LORD of hosts, And the Chaldean land is full of guilt to be punished
by the Holy One of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Flee out of Babylon; let each one save his
life, perish not for her guilt; This is a time of vengeance for the LORD, he
pays her her due. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the
LORD which made the whole earth drunk; The nations drank its wine, with this
they have become mad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Babylon suddenly falls and is crushed: howl
over her! Bring balm for her wounds, in case she can be healed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We have tried to heal Babylon, but she
cannot be healed. Leave her, let us go, each to his own land.&quot; Her
judgment reaches heaven, it touches the clouds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD has brought to light our just cause;
come, let us tell in Zion what the LORD, our God, has done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G5 href="__PQT.HTM#$2G5">1</a></sup></font></sup> Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers; The LORD
has stirred up the spirit of Media's kings; Babylon he is resolved to destroy.
Yes, it is the vengeance of the LORD, vengeance for his temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Against the walls of Babylon raise a signal,
make strong the watch; Post sentries, arrange ambushes! For the LORD has planned
and he will carry out his threat against the inhabitants of Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You who dwell by mighty waters, rich in
treasure, Your end has come, the term at which you shall be cut off! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself: I will
fill you with men as numerous as locusts, who shall raise over you the vintage
shout! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He has sworn who made the earth by his power,
and established the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his
skill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he thunders, the waters in the heavens
roar, and he brings up clouds from the end of the earth; He makes the lightning
flash in the rain, and releases stormwinds from their chambers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Every man is stupid, ignorant; every artisan is
put to shame by his idol: He molded a fraud, without breath of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nothingness are they, a ridiculous work, that
will perish in their time of punishment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Not like these is the portion of Jacob, he is
the creator of all things; Israel is his very own tribe, LORD of hosts is his
name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You are my hammer, my weapon for war; With you
I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With you I shatter horse and rider, with you I
shatter chariot and driver. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With you I shatter man and wife, with you I
shatter old and young, with you I shatter the youth and maiden. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With you I shatter the shepherd and his flock,
with you I shatter the farmer and his team, with you I shatter satraps and
prefects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus will I repay Babylon, and all who live in
Chaldea All the evil they did to Zion, as you shall see with your own eyes,
says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Beware! I am against you, destroying mountain,
destroyer of the entire earth, says the LORD; I will stretch forth my hand
against you, roll you down over the cliffs, and make you a burnt mountain: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They will not take from you a cornerstone, or a
foundation stone; Ruins forever shall you be, says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2G6 href="__PQT.HTM#$2G6">2</a></sup></font></sup> Raise a signal on the earth, blow the trumpet
among the nations; Dedicate peoples to war against her, summon against her the
kingdoms, Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz; Appoint recruiting officers against her,
send up horses like bristling locusts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Dedicate peoples to war against her: the king
of Media, Its governors and all its prefects, every land in his domain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The earth quakes and writhes, the LORD'S plan
against Babylon is carried out, Turning the land of Babylon into a desert where
no one lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Babylon's warriors have ceased to fight, they
remain in their strongholds; Dried up is their strength, they have become
women. Burned are their homes, and broken their bars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One runner meets another, herald meets herald,
Telling the king of Babylon that all his city is taken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The fords have been seized, and the fortresses
set on fire, while warriors are in panic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of
Israel: Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trodden;
Yet a little while, and the harvest time will come for her. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My torn flesh be upon Babylon, says the city on
Zion; My blood upon the people of Chaldea, says Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now, thus says the LORD: Surely I will
defend your cause, I will avenge you; I will dry up her sea, and drain her
fountain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Babylon shall become a heap of ruins, a haunt

slaughter, like rams and goats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How has she been seized, made captive, the
glory of the whole world! What a horror has Babylon become among nations: </p>

Babylon falls! </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Babylon, too, must fall, O slain of Israel, as
at the hands of Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth. </p>
