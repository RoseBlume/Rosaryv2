<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 21</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Hephzibah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, following
the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD had cleared out of the
way of the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He rebuilt the high places which his father
Hezekiah had destroyed. He erected altars to Baal, and also set up a sacred
pole, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done. He worshiped and served the whole host
of heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He built altars in the temple of the LORD,
about which the LORD had said, &quot;I will establish my name in
Jerusalem&quot; -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>altars for the whole host of heaven, in the two
courts of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He immolated his son by fire. He practiced
soothsaying and divination, and reintroduced the consulting of ghosts and
spirits. He did much evil in the LORD'S sight and provoked him to anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Asherah idol he had made, he set up in the
temple, of which the LORD had said to David and to his son Solomon: &quot;In
this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel, I shall place my name forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will not in future allow Israel to be driven
off the land I gave their fathers, provided that they are careful to observe
all I have commanded them, the entire law which my servant Moses enjoined upon
them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they did not listen, and Manasseh misled
them into doing even greater evil than the nations whom the LORD had destroyed
at the coming of the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD spoke through his servants the
prophets: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Because Manasseh, king of Judah, has
practiced these abominations and has done greater evil than all that was done
by the Amorites before him, and has led Judah into sin by his idols, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>therefore thus says the LORD, the God of
Israel: 'I will bring such evil on Jerusalem and Judah that, whenever anyone
hears of it, his ears shall ring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will measure Jerusalem with the same cord as
I did Samaria, and with the plummet I used for the house of Ahab. I will wipe
Jerusalem clean as one wipes a dish, wiping it inside and out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will cast off the survivors of my inheritance
and deliver them into enemy hands, to become a prey and a booty for all their
enemies, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because they have done evil in my sight and
provoked me from the day their fathers came forth from Egypt until
today.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In addition to the sin which he caused Judah to
commit, Manasseh did evil in the sight of the LORD, shedding so much innocent
blood as to fill the length and breadth of Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Manasseh, the sin he
committed and all that he did, are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was
buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. His son Amon succeeded him as
king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
father Manasseh had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He followed exactly the path his father had
trod, serving and worshiping the idols his father had served. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He abandoned the LORD, the God of his fathers,
and did not follow the path of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Subjects of Amon conspired against him and slew
the king in his palace, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but the people of the land then slew all who
had conspired against King Amon, and proclaimed his son Josiah king in his
stead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts that Amon did are written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was buried in his own grave in the garden of
Uzza, and his son Josiah succeeded him as king. </p>
