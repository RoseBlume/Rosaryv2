<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Josiah was eight years old when he became king,
and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He pleased the LORD, following the path of his
ancestor David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X4 href="__PBI.HTM#$X4">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the eighth year of his reign, while he was
still a youth, he began to seek after the God of his forefather David, and in
his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the
sacred poles and the carved and molten images. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In his presence, the altars of the Baals were
destroyed; the incense stands erected above them were torn down; the sacred
poles and the carved and molten images were shattered and beaten into dust,
which was strewn over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the bones of the priests he burned upon
their altars. Thus he purged Judah and Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did likewise in the cities of Manasseh,
Ephraim, Simeon, and in the ruined villages of the surrounding country as far
as Naphtali; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he destroyed the altars, broke up the sacred
poles and carved images and beat them into dust, and tore down the incense
stands throughout the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the eighteenth year of his reign, in order
to cleanse the temple as well as the land, he sent Shaphan, son of Azaliah,
Maaseiah, the ruler of the city, and Joah, son of Joahaz, the chamberlain, to
restore the house of the LORD, his God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They came to Hilkiah the high priest and turned
over the money brought to the house of God which the Levites, the guardians of
the threshold, had collected from Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the remnant of
Israel, as well as from all of Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They turned it over to the master workmen in
the house of the LORD, and these in turn used it to pay the workmen in the
LORD'S house who were restoring and repairing the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also gave it to the carpenters and the
masons to buy hewn stone and timber for the tie beams and rafters of the
buildings which the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The men worked faithfully at their task; their
overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the line of Merari, and Zechariah
and Meshullam, of the Kohathites, who directed them. All those Levites who were
skillful with musical instruments </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>were in charge of the men who carried the
burdens, and they directed all the workers in every kind of labor. Some of the
other Levites were scribes, officials and gatekeepers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they brought out the money that had been
deposited in the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the
law of the LORD given through Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He reported this to Shaphan the scribe, saying,
&quot;I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.&quot; Hilkiah
gave the book to Shaphan, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who brought it to the king at the same time
that he was making his report to him. He said, &quot;Your servants are doing
everything that has been entrusted to them; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they have turned into bullion the metals deposited
in the LORD'S house and have handed it over to the overseers and the
workmen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Shaphan the scribe announced to the king,
&quot;Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.&quot; And Shaphan read from it
before the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king heard the words of the law, he
tore his garments </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and issued this command to Hilkiah, to Ahikam,
son of Shaphan, to Abdon, son of Michah, to Shaphan the scribe, and to Asaiah,
the king's servant: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;On behalf of myself and those who are
left in Israel and Judah, go, consult the LORD concerning the words of the book
that has been found. For the anger of the LORD has been set furiously ablaze
against us, since our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD and have not
done all that is written in this book.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Hilkiah and the other men from the king
went to the prophetess Huldah, the wife of Shallum, son of Tokhath, son of
Hasrah, the guardian of the wardrobe; she dwelt in Jerusalem, in the new
quarter. They spoke to her as they had been instructed, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and she said to them: &quot;Thus says the LORD,
the God of Israel: 'Tell the one who sent you to me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD says: I am prepared to bring evil upon
this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses written in the book that
has been read before the king of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because they have abandoned me and have offered
incense to other gods, provoking me by every deed that they have performed, my
anger is ablaze against this place and cannot be extinguished.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But to the king of Judah who sent you to
consult the LORD, give this response: 'Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel,
concerning the threats you have heard: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because you were heartsick and have humbled
yourself before God on hearing his words spoken against this place and its
inhabitants; because you have humbled yourself before me, have torn your
garments, and have wept before me, I in turn have listened - so declares the
LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will gather you to your ancestors and you
shall be taken to your grave in peace. Your eyes shall not see all the evil I
will bring upon this place and upon its inhabitants.'&quot; They brought back
this message to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king now convened all the elders of Judah
and Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went up to the house of the LORD with all
the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites,
and all the people, great and small; and he had read aloud to them the entire
text of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X5 href="__PBI.HTM#$X5">2</a></sup></font></sup> Standing at his post, the king made a covenant
before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep his commandments, decrees, and
statutes with his whole heart and soul, thus observing the terms of the
covenant written in this book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He thereby committed all who were of Jerusalem
and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem conformed themselves to the
covenant of God, the God of their fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Josiah removed every abominable thing from all
the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he obliged all who were in Israel
to serve the LORD, their God. During his lifetime they did not desert the LORD,
the God of their fathers. </p>

Josiah's reform began only after the discovery of the book of the law in the
temple, in the eighteenth year of his reign. But the Chronicler is no doubt
right in placing the beginning of the reform at an earlier period. The very
repair of the temple, which led to the finding of the book of the law, must
have been occasioned by a cultic reform. </p>
