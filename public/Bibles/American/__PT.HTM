<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3Z href="__PT.HTM#$3Z">1</a></sup></font></sup> When Isaac was so old that his eyesight had
failed him, he called his older son Esau and said to him, &quot;Son!&quot;
&quot;Yes, father!&quot; he replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Isaac then said, &quot;As you can see, I am so
old that I may now die at any time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take your gear, therefore - your quiver and bow
- and go out into the country to hunt some game for me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40 href="__PT.HTM#$40">2</a></sup></font></sup> With your catch prepare an appetizing dish for
me, such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my
special blessing before I die.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rebekah had been listening while Isaac was
speaking to his son Esau. So when Esau went out into the country to hunt some
game for his father, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, &quot;Listen! I
overheard your father tell your brother Esau, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'Bring me some game and with it prepare an
appetizing dish for me to eat, that I may give you my blessing with the LORD'S
approval before I die.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, son, listen carefully to what I tell you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Go to the flock and get me two choice kids.
With these I will prepare an appetizing dish for your father, such as he likes.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then bring it to your father to eat, that he
may bless you before he dies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But my brother Esau is a hairy man,&quot;
said Jacob to his mother Rebekah, &quot;and I am smooth-skinned! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Suppose my father feels me? He will think I am
making sport of him, and I shall bring on myself a curse instead of a
blessing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His mother, however, replied: &quot;Let any
curse against you, son, fall on me! Just do as I say. Go and get me the
kids.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jacob went and got them and brought them to
his mother; and with them she prepared an appetizing dish, such as his father
liked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older
son Esau that she had in the house, and gave them to her younger son Jacob to
wear; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and with the skins of the kids she covered up
his hands and the hairless parts of his neck. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then she handed her son Jacob the appetizing
dish and the bread she had prepared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bringing them to his father, Jacob said,
&quot;Father!&quot; &quot;Yes?&quot; replied Isaac. &quot;Which of my sons are
you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob answered his father: &quot;I am Esau,
your first-born. I did as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game,
so that you may give me your special blessing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Isaac asked, &quot;How did you succeed so
quickly, son?&quot; He answered, &quot;The LORD, your God, let things turn out
well with me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Isaac then said to Jacob, &quot;Come closer,
son, that I may feel you, to learn whether you really are my son Esau or
not.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jacob moved up closer to his father. When
Isaac felt him, he said, &quot;Although the voice is Jacob's, the hands are
Esau's.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(He failed to identify him because his hands
were hairy, like those of his brother Esau; so in the end he gave him his
blessing.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again he asked him, &quot;Are you really my son
Esau?&quot; &quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Isaac said, &quot;Serve me your game, son,
that I may eat of it and then give you my blessing.&quot; Jacob served it to
him, and Isaac ate; he brought him wine, and he drank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally his father Isaac said to him,
&quot;Come closer, son, and kiss me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Jacob went up and kissed him, Isaac smelled
the fragrance of his clothes. With that, he blessed him, saying, &quot;Ah, the
fragrance of my son is like the fragrance of a field that the LORD has blessed!
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;May God give to you of the dew of the
heavens And of the fertility of the earth abundance of grain and wine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Let peoples serve you, and nations pay
you homage; Be master of your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to
you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be those who bless you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob had scarcely left his father, just after
Isaac had finished blessing him, when his brother Esau came back from his hunt.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he too prepared an appetizing dish with
his game, and bringing it to his father, he said, &quot;Please, father, eat
some of your son's game, that you may then give me your special blessing.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Who are you?&quot; his father Isaac asked
him. &quot;I am Esau,&quot; he replied, &quot;your first-born son.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With that, Isaac was seized with a fit of
uncontrollable trembling. &quot;Who was it, then,&quot; he asked, &quot;that
hunted game and brought it to me? I finished eating it just before you came,
and I blessed him. Now he must remain blessed!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On hearing his father's words, Esau burst into
loud, bitter sobbing. &quot;Father, bless me too!&quot; he begged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Isaac explained, &quot;Your brother came
here by a ruse and carried off your blessing,&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-41 href="__PT.HTM#$41">3</a></sup></font></sup> Esau exclaimed, &quot;He has been well named
Jacob! He has now supplanted me twice! First he took away my birthright, and
now he has taken away my blessing.&quot; Then he pleaded, &quot;Haven't you
saved a blessing for me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Isaac replied: &quot;I have already appointed
him your master, and I have assigned to him all his kinsmen as his slaves;
besides, I have enriched him with grain and wine. What then can I do for you,
son?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Esau urged his father, &quot;Have you only
that one blessing, father? Bless me too!&quot; Isaac, however, made no reply;
and Esau wept aloud. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally Isaac spoke again and said to him:
&quot;Ah, far from the fertile earth shall be your dwelling; far from the dew
of the heavens above! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;By your sword you shall live, and your
brother you shall serve; But when you become restive, you shall throw off his
yoke from your neck.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Esau bore Jacob a grudge because of the
blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, &quot;When the time of
mourning for my father comes, I will kill my brother Jacob.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Rebekah got news of what her older son
Esau had in mind, she called her younger son Jacob and said to him:
&quot;Listen! Your brother Esau intends to settle accounts with you by killing
you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, son, do what I tell you: flee at
once to my brother Laban in Haran, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and stay with him a while until your brother's
fury subsides </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(until your brother's anger against you
subsides) and he forgets what you did to him. Then I will send for you and
bring you back. Must I lose both of you in a single day?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42 href="__PT.HTM#$42">4</a></sup></font></sup> Rebekah said to Isaac: &quot;I am disgusted
with life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob also should marry a Hittite
woman, a native of the land, like these women, what good would life be to
me?&quot; </p>

his father and thereby cheating Esau out of Isaac's deathbed blessing is
condemned as blameworthy, not only by Hosea (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PTC.HTM#PROPHB.HOS.12.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hosea
12:4) and Jeremiah (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PPN.HTM#PROPHB.JER.9.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Jeremiah 9:3), but
also, indirectly, by the Yahwist narrator of the present story, who makes the
reader sympathize with Esau as the innocent victim of a cruel plot, and shows
that Jacob and his mother, the instigator of the plot, paid for it by a
lifelong separation from each other. The story was told because it was part of
the mystery of God's ways in salvation history - his use of weak, sinful men to
achieve his own ultimate purpose.</p>

racial purity among the chosen people. The account of Esau's marriages is given
for the purpose of explaining the racial mixture of the Edomites, who were
descended in part from tribes related to Israel, in part from older peoples in
Edom called Hittites, Horites or Hivites, and in part from the Ishmaelite
(Arabian) tribes who later invaded the region. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
