<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 16</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>John then went up from Gazara and told his
father Simon what Cendebeus was doing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Simon called his two oldest sons, Judas and
John, and said to them: &quot;I and my brothers and my father's house have
fought the battles of Israel from our youth until today, and many times we
succeeded in saving Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have now grown old, but you, by the mercy of
Heaven, have come to man's estate. Take my place and my brother's, and go out
and fight for our nation; and may the help of Heaven be with you!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>John then mustered in the land twenty thousand
warriors and horsemen. Setting out against Cendebeus, they spent the night at
Modein, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>rose early, and marched into the plain. There,
facing them, was an immense army of foot soldiers and horsemen, and between the
two armies was a stream. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>John and his men took their position against
the enemy. Seeing that his men were afraid to cross the stream, John crossed
first. When his men saw this, they crossed over after him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he divided his infantry into two corps and
put his cavalry between them, for the enemy's horsemen were very numerous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They blew the trumpets, and Cendebeus and his
army were put to flight; many of them fell wounded, and the rest fled toward
the stronghold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was then that John's brother Judas fell
wounded; but John pursued them until Cendebeus reached Kedron, which he had
fortified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some took refuge in the towers on the plain of
Azotus, but John set fire to these, and about two thousand of the enemy
perished. He then returned to Judea in peace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ptolemy, son of Abubus, had been appointed
governor of the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>being the son-in-law of the high priest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he became ambitious and sought to get
control of the country. So he made treacherous plans to do away with Simon and
his sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14L href="__PE3.HTM#$14L">1</a></sup></font></sup> As Simon was inspecting the cities of the
country and providing for their needs, he and his sons Mattathias and Judas
went down to Jericho in the year one hundred and seventy-seven, in the eleventh
month (that is, the month Shebat). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14M href="__PE3.HTM#$14M">2</a></sup></font></sup> The son of Abubus gave them a deceitful
welcome in the little stronghold called Dok which he had built. While serving
them a sumptuous banquet, he had his men hidden there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, when Simon and his sons had drunk freely,
Ptolemy and his men sprang up, weapons in hand, rushed upon Simon in the
banquet hall, and killed him, his two sons, and some of his servants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By this vicious act of treason he repaid good
with evil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ptolemy wrote an account of this and sent
it to the king, asking that troops be sent to help him and that the country be
turned over to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent other men to Gazara to do away with
John. To the army officers he sent letters inviting them to come to him so that
he might present them with silver, gold, and gifts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also sent others to seize Jerusalem and the
mount of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But someone ran ahead and brought word to John
at Gazara that his father and his brothers had perished, and that Ptolemy had
sent men to kill him also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On hearing this, John was utterly astounded.
When the men came to kill him, he had them arrested and put to death, for he
knew what they meant to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-14N href="__PE3.HTM#$14N">3</a></sup></font></sup> Now the rest of the history of John, his wars
and the brave deeds he performed, his rebuilding of the walls, and his other
achievements - </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>these things are recorded in the chronicle of
his pontificate, from the time that he succeeded his father as high priest. </p>
