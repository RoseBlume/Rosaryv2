<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time Abijah, son of Jeroboam, took
sick. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jeroboam said to his wife, &quot;Get ready
and disguise yourself so that none will recognize you as Jeroboam's wife. Then
go to Shiloh, where you will find the prophet Ahijah. It was he who predicted
my reign over this people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take along ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of
preserves, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the child.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The wife of Jeroboam obeyed. She made the
journey to Shiloh and entered the house of Ahijah who could not see because age
had dimmed his sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD had said to Ahijah: &quot;Jeroboam's
wife is coming to consult you about her son, for he is sick. This is what you
must tell her. When she comes, she will be in disguise.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Ahijah, hearing the sound of her footsteps
as she entered the door, said, &quot;Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you in
disguise? I have been commissioned to give you bitter news. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Go, tell Jeroboam, 'This is what the LORD, the
God of Israel, says: I exalted you from among the people and made you ruler of
my people Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I deprived the house of David of the kingdom
and gave it to you. Yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my
commandments and followed me with his whole heart, doing only what pleased me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have done worse than all who preceded you: you
have gone and made for yourself strange gods and molten images to provoke me;
but me you have cast behind your back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, I am bringing evil upon the house of
Jeroboam: I will cut off every male in Jeroboam's line, whether slave or
freeman in Israel, and will burn up the house of Jeroboam completely, as though
dung were being burned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When one of Jeroboam's line dies in the city,
dogs will devour him; when one of them dies in the field, he will be devoured
by the birds of the sky. For the LORD has spoken!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So leave; go home! As you step inside the city,
the child will die, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and all Israel will mourn him and bury him, for
he alone of Jeroboam's line will be laid in the grave, since in him alone of
Jeroboam's house has something pleasing to the LORD, the God of Israel, been
found. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Today, at this very moment, the LORD will raise
up for himself a king of Israel who will destroy the house of Jeroboam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD will strike Israel like a reed tossed
about in the water and will pluck out Israel from this good land which he gave
their fathers, scattering them beyond the River, because they made sacred poles
for themselves and thus provoked the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will give up Israel because of the sins
Jeroboam has committed and caused Israel to commit.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jeroboam's wife started back; when she
reached Tirzah and crossed the threshold of her house, the child died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was buried with all Israel mourning him, as
the LORD had prophesied through his servant the prophet Ahijah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jeroboam, with his
warfare and his reign, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The length of Jeroboam's reign was twenty-two
years. He rested with his ancestors, and his son Nadab succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rehoboam, son of Solomon, reigned in Judah. He
was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in
Jerusalem, the city in which, out of all the tribes of Israel, the LORD chose
to be honored. His mother was the Ammonite named Naamah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and by
their sins angered him even more than their fathers had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They, too, built for themselves high places,
pillars, and sacred poles, upon every high hill and under every green tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were also cult prostitutes in the land.
Judah imitated all the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD had
cleared out of the Israelites' way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S8 href="__P8S.HTM#$S8">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak,
king of Egypt, attacked Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He took everything, including the treasures of
the temple of the LORD and those of the royal palace, as well as all the gold
shields made under Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To replace them, King Rehoboam had bronze
shields made, which he entrusted to the officers of the guard on duty at the
entrance of the royal palace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whenever the king visited the temple of the
LORD, those on duty would carry the shields, and then return them to the
guardroom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Rehoboam, with all that
he did, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was constant warfare between Rehoboam and
Jeroboam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rehoboam rested with his ancestors; he was

Naamah. His son Abijam succeeded him as king. </p>

<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PAW.HTM#HIS.2CHR.12.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Chron 12:1-12, the repentance of King Rehoboam
and of the princes of Israel after the warning of the prophet Shemaiah diverted
the actual attack on Jerusalem. Shishak, however, carried off the treasures of
the temple of the LORD and of the king's palace (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PAW.HTM#HIS.2CHR.12.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 2 Chron
12:9). A bas-relief of this Pharaoh in the temple of Amon at Karnak
commemorates his conquest of some hundred and fifty Palestinian and
Transjordanian cities and towns. </p>
