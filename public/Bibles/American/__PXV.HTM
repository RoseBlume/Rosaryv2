<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had gathered together they asked him,
&quot;Lord, are you at this time going <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3ZP href="__PXV.HTM#$3ZP">4</a></sup></font></sup> to restore the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3ZQ href="__PXV.HTM#$3ZQ">5</a></sup></font></sup> He answered them, &quot;It is not for you to

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had said this, as they were looking on,
he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While they were looking intently at the sky as
he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white garments stood beside them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said, &quot;Men of Galilee, why are you
standing there looking at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken up from you
into heaven will return in the same way as you have seen him going into
heaven.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount
called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they entered the city they went to the
upper room where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip
and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and
Judas son of James. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All these devoted themselves with one accord to
prayer, together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his
brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During those days Peter stood up in the midst
of the brothers (there was a group of about one hundred and twenty persons in
the one place). He said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;My brothers, the scripture had to be
fulfilled which the holy Spirit spoke beforehand through the mouth of David,
concerning Judas, who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was numbered among us and was allotted a
share in this ministry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He bought a parcel of land with the wages of
his iniquity, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle, and all his
insides spilled out. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3ZS href="__PXV.HTM#$3ZS">7</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This became known to everyone who lived in
Jerusalem, so that the parcel of land was called in their language 'Akeldama,'
that is, Field of Blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For it is written in the Book of Psalms: 'Let
his encampment become desolate, and may no one dwell in it.' And: 'May another
take his office.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, it is necessary that one of the men
who accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus came and went among us, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>beginning from the baptism of John until the
day on which he was taken up from us, become with us a witness to his
resurrection.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas,
who was also known as Justus, and Matthias. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they prayed, &quot;You, Lord, who know the
hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to take the place in this apostolic ministry
from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3ZT href="__PXV.HTM#$3ZT">8</a></sup></font></sup> Then they gave lots to them, and the lot fell
upon Matthias, and he was counted with the eleven apostles. </p>

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:1-2) connects Acts with the Gospel of Luke,
shows that the apostles were instructed by the risen Jesus
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:3-5), points out that the parousia or
second coming in glory of Jesus will occur as certainly as his ascension
occurred (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:6-11), and lists the members of
the Twelve, stressing their role as a body of divinely mandated witnesses to
his life, teaching, and resurrection (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
1:12-26). </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZN href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZN">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [3] Appearing to them during forty
days: Luke considered especially sacred the interval in which the appearances
and instructions of the risen Jesus occurred and expressed it therefore in
terms of the sacred number forty (cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4N.HTM#PENT.DEU.8.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 8:2). In
his gospel, however, Luke connects the ascension of Jesus with the resurrection
by describing the ascension on Easter Sunday evening (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX7.HTM#GOSP.LUK.24.50"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
24:50-53). What should probably be understood as one event
(resurrection, glorification, ascension, sending of the Spirit - the paschal
mystery) has been historicized by Luke when he writes of a visible ascension of
Jesus after forty days and the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost. For Luke,
the ascension marks the end of the appearances of Jesus except for the
extraordinary appearance to Paul. With regard to Luke's understanding of
salvation history, the ascension also marks the end of the time of Jesus
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX7.HTM#GOSP.LUK.24.50"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 24:50-53) and signals the beginning of the
time of the church.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZO href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZO">3</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [4] The promise of the Father: the
holy Spirit, as is clear from the next verse. This gift of the Spirit was first
promised in Jesus' final instructions to his chosen witnesses in Luke's gospel
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX7.HTM#GOSP.LUK.24.49"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 24:49) and formed part of the continuing
instructions of the risen Jesus on the kingdom of God, of which Luke speaks in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXV.HTM#GOSP.ACT.1.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 1:3.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZP href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZP">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [6] The question of the disciples
implies that in believing Jesus to be the Christ (see the note on
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWL.HTM#GOSP.LUK.2.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 2:11) they had expected him to be a political
leader who would restore self-rule to Israel during his historical ministry.
When this had not taken place, they ask if it is to take place at this time,
the period of the church.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZQ href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZQ">5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [7] This verse echoes the tradition
that the precise time of the parousia is not revealed to human beings; cf
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWF.HTM#GOSP.MAR.13.32"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 13:32; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P10T.HTM#NTLET.1THE.5.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Thes
5:1-3.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZR href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZR">6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [8] Just as Jerusalem was the city
of destiny in the Gospel of Luke (the place where salvation was accomplished),
so here at the beginning of Acts, Jerusalem occupies a central position. It is
the starting point for the mission of the Christian disciples to &quot;the ends
of the earth,&quot; the place where the apostles were situated and the
doctrinal focal point in the early days of the community
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY9.HTM#GOSP.ACT.15.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 15:2, 6). The
ends of the earth: for Luke, this means Rome.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZS href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZS">7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [18] Luke records a popular
tradition about the death of Judas that differs from the one in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW0.HTM#GOSP.MAT.27.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 27:5, according to which Judas hanged
himself. Here, although the text is not certain, Judas is depicted as
purchasing a piece of property with the betrayal money and being killed on it
in a fall.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3ZT href="__PXV.HTM#-3ZT">8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [26] The need to replace Judas was
probably dictated by the symbolism of the number twelve, recalling the twelve
tribes of Israel. This symbolism also indicates that for Luke (see
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX5.HTM#GOSP.LUK.22.30"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 22:30) the Christian church is a
reconstituted Israel.</p>
