<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After all this was over, those Israelites who
had been present went forth to the cities of Judah and smashed the sacred
pillars, cut down the sacred poles, and tore down the high places and altars
throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh, until all were destroyed.
Then the Israelites returned to their various cities, each to his own
possession. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah reestablished the classes of the
priests and the Levites according to their former classification, assigning to
each priest and Levite his proper service, whether in regard to holocausts or
peace offerings, thanksgiving or praise, or ministering in the gates of the
encampment of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From his own wealth the king allotted a portion
for holocausts, those of morning and evening and those on sabbaths, new moons
and festivals, as prescribed in the law of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also commanded the people living in
Jerusalem to provide the support of the priests and Levites, that they might
devote themselves entirely to the law of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as the order was promulgated, the
Israelites brought, in great quantities, the best of their grain, wine, oil and
honey, and all the produce of the fields; they gave a generous tithe of
everything. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israelites and Judahites living in other cities
of Judah also brought in tithes of oxen, sheep, and things that had been
consecrated to the LORD, their God; these they brought in and set out in heaps.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X0 href="__PBF.HTM#$X0">1</a></sup></font></sup> It was in the third month that they began to
establish these heaps, and they completed them in the seventh month. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Hezekiah and the princes had come and seen
the heaps, they blessed the LORD and his people Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the
Levites concerning the heaps, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the priest Azariah, head of the house of
Zadoc, answered him, &quot;Since they began to bring the offerings to the house
of the LORD, we have eaten to the full and have had much left over, for the
LORD has blessed his people. This great supply is what was left over.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah then gave orders that chambers be
constructed in the house of the LORD. When this had been done, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the offerings, tithes and consecrated things
were deposited there in safekeeping. The overseer of these things was Conaniah
the Levite, and his brother Shimei was second in charge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth,
Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors subject to
Conaniah and his brother Shimei by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah,
the prefect of the house of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Kore, the son of Imnah, a Levite and the keeper
of the eastern gate, was in charge of the free-will gifts made to God; he
distributed the offerings made to the LORD and the most holy of the consecrated
things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Under him in the priestly cities were Eden,
Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah, who faithfully made the
distribution to their brethren, great and small alike, according to their
classes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was also a register by ancestral houses
of males thirty years of age and over, for all priests who were eligible to
enter the house of the LORD according to the daily rule to fulfill their
service in the order of their classes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priests were inscribed in their family
records according to their ancestral houses, and the Levites of twenty years
and over according to their various offices and classes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A distribution was also made to all who were
inscribed in the family records, for their little ones, wives, sons and
daughters - thus for the entire assembly, since they were to sanctify
themselves by sharing faithfully in the consecrated things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sons of Aaron, the priests who lived on the
lands attached to their cities, had in every city men designated by name to
distribute portions to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed
in the family records. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This Hezekiah did in all Judah. He did what was
good, upright and faithful before the LORD, his God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Everything that he undertook, for the service
of the house of God or for the law and the commandments, was to do the will of
his God. He did this wholeheartedly, and he prospered. </p>
