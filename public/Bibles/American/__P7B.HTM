<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines rallied their forces for battle
at Socoh in Judah and camped between Socoh and Azekah at Ephes-dammim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul and the Israelites also gathered and
camped in the Vale of the Terebinth, drawing up their battle line to meet the
Philistines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines were stationed on one hill and
the Israelites on an opposite hill, with a valley between them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A champion named Goliath of Gath came out from
the Philistine camp; he was six and a half feet tall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a bronze
corselet of scale armor weighing five thousand shekels, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PX href="__P7B.HTM#$PX">1</a></sup></font></sup> and bronze greaves, and had a bronze scimitar
slung from a baldric. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PY href="__P7B.HTM#$PY">2</a></sup></font></sup> The shaft of his javelin was like a weaver's
heddle-bar, and its iron head weighed six hundred shekels. His shield-bearer
went before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel:
&quot;Why come out in battle formation? I am a Philistine, and you are Saul's
servants. Choose one of your men, and have him come down to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If he beats me in combat and kills me, we will
be your vassals; but if I beat him and kill him, you shall be our vassals and
serve us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistine continued: &quot;I defy the
ranks of Israel today. Give me a man and let us fight together.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul and all the men of Israel, when they heard
this challenge of the Philistine, were dismayed and terror-stricken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PZ href="__P7B.HTM#$PZ">3</a></sup></font></sup> (David was the son of an Ephrathite named
Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. He had eight sons, and in the days of
Saul was old and well on in years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed
Saul to war; these three sons who had gone off to war were named, the first-born
Eliab, the second son Abinadab, and the third Shammah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David was the youngest. While the three oldest
had joined Saul, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David would go and come from Saul to tend his
father's sheep at Bethlehem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Meanwhile the Philistine came forward and took
his stand morning and evening for forty days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Now Jesse said to his son David: &quot;Take
this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves for your brothers, and bring
them quickly to your brothers in the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Also take these ten cheeses for the field
officer. Greet your brothers and bring home some token from them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul, and they, and all Israel are fighting against
the Philistines in the Vale of the Terebinth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning, having left the flock
with a shepherd, David set out on his errand, as Jesse had commanded him. He
reached the barricade of the camp just as the army, on their way to the
battleground, were shouting their battle cry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites and the Philistines drew up
opposite each other in battle array. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David entrusted what he had brought to the
keeper of the baggage and hastened to the battle line, where he greeted his
brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While he was talking with them, the Philistine
champion, by name Goliath of Gath, came up from the ranks of the Philistines
and spoke as before, and David listened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Israelites saw the man, they all
retreated before him, very much afraid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites had been saying: &quot;Do you
see this man coming up? He comes up to insult Israel. If anyone should kill
him, the king would give him great wealth, and his daughter as well, and would
grant exemption to his father's family in Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David now said to the men standing by:
&quot;What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and frees Israel
of the disgrace? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine in any case, that he
should insult the armies of the living God?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They repeated the same words to him and said,
&quot;That is how the man who kills him will be rewarded.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Eliab, his oldest brother, heard him
speaking with the men, he grew angry with David and said: &quot;Why did you
come down? With whom have you left those sheep in the desert meanwhile? I know
your arrogance and your evil intent. You came down to enjoy the battle!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David replied, &quot;What have I done now? - I
was only talking.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet he turned from him to another and asked the
same question; and everyone gave him the same answer as before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The words that David had spoken were overheard
and reported to Saul, who sent for him.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David spoke to Saul: &quot;Let your
majesty not lose courage. I am at your service to go and fight this
Philistine.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Saul answered David, &quot;You cannot go up
against this Philistine and fight with him, for you are only a youth, while he
has been a warrior from his youth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David told Saul: &quot;Your servant used
to tend his father's sheep, and whenever a lion or bear came to carry off a
sheep from the flock, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I would go after it and attack it and rescue
the prey from its mouth. If it attacked me, I would seize it by the jaw, strike
it, and kill it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your servant has killed both a lion and a bear,
and this uncircumcised Philistine will be as one of them, because he has
insulted the armies of the living God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David continued: &quot;The LORD, who delivered
me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will also keep me safe from the
clutches of this Philistine.&quot; Saul answered David, &quot;Go! the LORD will
be with you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic,
putting a bronze helmet on his head and arming him with a coat of mail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David also girded himself with Saul's sword
over the tunic. He walked with difficulty, however, since he had never tried
armor before. He said to Saul, &quot;I cannot go in these, because I have never
tried them before.&quot; So he took them off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, staff in hand, David selected five smooth
stones from the wadi and put them in the pocket of his shepherd's bag. With his
sling also ready to hand, he approached the Philistine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With his shield-bearer marching before him, the
Philistine also advanced closer and closer to David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had sized David up, and seen that he
was youthful, and ruddy, and handsome in appearance, he held him in contempt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistine said to David, &quot;Am I a dog
that you come against me with a staff?&quot; Then the Philistine cursed David
by his gods </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to him, &quot;Come here to me, and I
will leave your flesh for the birds of the air and the beasts of the
field.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David answered him: &quot;You come against me
with sword and spear and scimitar, but I come against you in the name of the
LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel that you have insulted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Today the LORD shall deliver you into my hand;
I will strike you down and cut off your head. This very day I will leave your
corpse and the corpses of the Philistine army for the birds of the air and the
beasts of the field; thus the whole land shall learn that Israel has a God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All this multitude, too, shall learn that it is
not by sword or spear that the LORD saves. For the battle is the LORD'S, and he
shall deliver you into our hands.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistine then moved to meet David at
close quarters, while David ran quickly toward the battle line in the direction
of the Philistine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David put his hand into the bag and took out a
stone, hurled it with the sling, and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The
stone embedded itself in his brow, and he fell prostrate on the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Thus David overcame the Philistine with sling
and stone; he struck the Philistine mortally, and did it without a sword.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David ran and stood over him; with the
Philistine's own sword (which he drew from its sheath) he dispatched him and
cut off his head.When they saw that their hero was dead, the Philistines took
to flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the men of Israel and Judah, with loud
shouts, went in pursuit of the Philistines to the approaches of Gath and to the
gates of Ekron, and Philistines fell wounded along the road from Shaaraim as
far as Gath and Ekron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On their return from the pursuit of the Philistines,
the Israelites looted their camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q0 href="__P7B.HTM#$Q0">4</a></sup></font></sup> David took the head of the Philistine and
brought it to Jerusalem; but he kept Goliath's armor in his own tent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(When Saul saw David go out to meet the Philistine,
he asked his general Abner, &quot;Abner, whose son is that youth?&quot; Abner
replied, &quot;As truly as your majesty is alive, I have no idea.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the king said, &quot;Find out whose son the
lad is.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when David returned from slaying the
Philistine, Abner took him and presented him to Saul. David was still holding
the Philistine's head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then asked him, &quot;Whose son are you,
young man?&quot; David replied, &quot;I am the son of your servant Jesse of
Bethlehem.&quot; </p>
