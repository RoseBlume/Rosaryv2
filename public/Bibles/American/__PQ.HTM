<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abraham had now reached a ripe old age, and the
LORD had blessed him in every way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3I href="__PQ.HTM#$3I">1</a></sup></font></sup> Abraham said to the senior servant of his
household, who had charge of all his possessions: &quot;Put your hand under my
thigh, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God
of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not procure a wife for my son
from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I live, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but that you will go to my own land and to my kindred
to get a wife for my son Isaac.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The servant asked him: &quot;What if the woman
is unwilling to follow me to this land? Should I then take your son back to the
land from which you migrated?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Never take my son back there for any
reason,&quot; Abraham told him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me
from my father's house and the land of my kin, and who confirmed by oath the
promise he then made to me, 'I will give this land to your descendants' - he
will send his messenger before you, and you will obtain a wife for my son
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If the woman is unwilling to follow you, you
will be released from this oath. But never take my son back there!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of
his master Abraham and swore to him in this undertaking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3J href="__PQ.HTM#$3J">2</a></sup></font></sup> The servant then took ten of his master's
camels, and bearing all kinds of gifts from his master, he made his way to the
city of Nahor in Aram Naharaim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Near evening, at the time when women go out to
draw water, he made the camels kneel by the well outside the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3K href="__PQ.HTM#$3K">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then he prayed: &quot;LORD, God of my master Abraham,
let it turn out favorably for me today and thus deal graciously with my master
Abraham. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While I stand here at the spring and the
daughters of the townsmen are coming out to draw water, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>if I say to a girl, 'Please lower your jug,
that I may drink,' and she answers, 'Take a drink, and let me give water to
your camels, too,' let her be the one whom you have decided upon for your
servant Isaac. In this way I shall know that you have dealt graciously with my
master.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had scarcely finished these words when
Rebekah (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham's brother
Nahor) came out with a jug on her shoulder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The girl was very beautiful, a virgin, untouched
by man. She went down to the spring and filled her jug. As she came up, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the servant ran toward her and said,
&quot;Please give me a sip of water from your jug.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Take a drink, sir,&quot; she replied, and
quickly lowering the jug onto her hand, she gave him a drink. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When she had let him drink his fill, she said,
&quot;I will draw water for your camels, too, until they have drunk their
fill.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With that, she quickly emptied her jug into the
drinking trough and ran back to the well to draw more water, until she had
drawn enough for all the camels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man watched her the whole time, silently
waiting to learn whether or not the LORD had made his errand successful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the camels had finished drinking, the man
took out a gold ring weighing half a shekel, which he fastened on her nose, and
two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels, which he put on her wrists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he asked her: &quot;Whose daughter are
you? Tell me, please. And is there room in your father's house for us to spend
the night?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She answered: &quot;I am the daughter of
Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There is plenty of straw and fodder at our
place,&quot; she added, &quot;and room to spend the night.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man then bowed down in worship to the LORD,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying: &quot;Blessed be the LORD, the God of
my master Abraham, who has not let his constant kindness toward my master fail.
As for myself also, the LORD has led me straight to the house of my master's
brother.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the girl ran off and told her mother's
household about it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as he saw the ring and the bracelets on
his sister Rebekah and heard her words about what the man had said to her,
Laban rushed outside to the man at the spring. When he reached him, he was
still standing by the camels at the spring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said to him: &quot;Come, blessed of the
LORD! Why are you staying outside when I have made the house ready for you, as
well as a place for the camels?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man then went inside; and while the camels
were being unloaded and provided with straw and fodder, water was brought to
bathe his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the table was set for him, he said,
&quot;I will not eat until I have told my tale.&quot; &quot;Do so,&quot; they
replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I am Abraham's servant,&quot; he began. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The LORD has blessed my master so
abundantly that he has become a wealthy man; he has given him flocks and herds,
silver and gold, male and female slaves, and camels and asses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My master's wife Sarah bore a son to my master
in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My master put me under oath, saying: 'You shall
not procure a wife for my son among the daughters of the Canaanites in whose
land I live; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>instead, you shall go to my father's house, to
my own relatives, to get a wife for my son.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I asked my master, 'What if the woman will
not follow me?,' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
he replied: 'The LORD, in whose presence I have always walked, will send his
messenger with you and make your errand successful, and so you will get a wife
for my son from my own kindred of my father's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then you shall be released from my ban. If you
visit my kindred and they refuse you, then, too, you shall be released from my
ban.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
&quot;When I came to the spring today, I prayed: 'LORD, God of my master
Abraham, may it be your will to make successful the errand I am engaged on! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While I stand here at the spring, if I say to a
young woman who comes out to draw water, Please give me a little water from
your jug, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
and she answers, Not only may you have a drink, but I will give water to your
camels, too - let her be the woman whom the LORD has decided upon for my
master's son.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I had scarcely finished saying this
prayer to myself when Rebekah came out with a jug on her shoulder. After she
went down to the spring and drew water, I said to her, 'Please let me have a
drink.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
She quickly lowered the jug she was carrying and said, 'Take a drink, and let
me bring water for your camels, too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels
also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' she
answered, 'The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, borne to Nahor by Milcah.' So
I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
Then I bowed down in worship to the LORD, blessing the LORD, the God of my
master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to obtain the daughter of my
master's kinsman for his son. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, therefore, you have in mind to show true
loyalty to my master, let me know; but if not, let me know that, too. I can
then proceed accordingly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
Laban and his household said in reply: &quot;This thing comes from the LORD; we
can say nothing to you either for or against it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Here is Rebekah, ready for you; take her with
you, that she may become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has
said.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
When Abraham's servant heard their answer, he bowed to the ground before the
LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he brought out objects of silver and gold
and articles of clothing and presented them to Rebekah; he also gave costly
presents to her brother and mother. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
After he and the men with him had eaten and drunk, they spent the night there.
When they were up the next morning, he said, &quot;Give me leave to return to
my master.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Her brother and mother replied, &quot;Let the
girl stay with us a short while, say ten days; after that she may go.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
But he said to them, &quot;Do not detain me, now that the LORD has made my
errand successful; let me go back to my master.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered, &quot;Let us call the girl and
see what she herself has to say about it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
So they called Rebekah and asked her, &quot;Do you wish to go with this
man?&quot; She answered, &quot;I do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>59
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this they allowed their sister Rebekah and
her nurse to take leave, along with Abraham's servant and his men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60
Invoking a blessing on Rebekah, they said: &quot;Sister, may you grow into
thousands of myriads; And may your descendants gain possession of the gates of
their enemies!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>61
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Rebekah and her maids started out; they
mounted their camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went
on his way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>62
Meanwhile Isaac had gone from Beer-lahai-roi and was living in the region of
the Negeb. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>63
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3L href="__PQ.HTM#$3L">4</a></sup></font></sup> One day toward evening he went out. . . in the
field, and as he looked around, he noticed that camels were approaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>64
Rebekah, too, was looking about, and when she saw him, she alighted from her
camel </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>65
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and asked the servant, &quot;Who is the man out
there, walking through the fields toward us?&quot; &quot;That is my
master,&quot; replied the servant. Then she covered herself with her veil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>66
The servant recounted to Isaac all the things he had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>67
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Isaac took Rebekah into his tent; he married
her, and thus she became his wife. In his love for her Isaac found solace after
the death of his mother Sarah. </p>
