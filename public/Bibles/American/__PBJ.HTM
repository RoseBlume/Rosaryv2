<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 35</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Josiah celebrated in Jerusalem a Passover to
honor the LORD; the Passover sacrifice was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of
the first month. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He reappointed the priests to their duties and
encouraged them in the service of the LORD'S house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to the Levites who were to instruct all
Israel, and who were consecrated to the LORD: &quot;Put the holy ark in the
house built by Solomon, son of David, king of Israel. It shall no longer be a
burden on your shoulders. Serve now the LORD, your God, and his people Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Prepare yourselves in your ancestral houses and
your classes according to the prescriptions of King David of Israel and his son
Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Stand in the sanctuary according to the
divisions of the ancestral houses of your brethren, the common people, so that
the distribution of the Levites and the families may be the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Slay the Passover sacrifice, sanctify
yourselves, and be at the disposition of your brethren, that all may be carried
out according to the word of the LORD given through Moses.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Josiah contributed to the common people a flock
of lambs and kids, thirty thousand in number, each to serve as a Passover
victim for any who were present, and also three thousand oxen; these were from
the king's property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His princes also gave a free-will gift to the
people, the priests and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, prefects of
the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover victims
together with three hundred oxen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah, Nethanel,
Hashabiah, Jehiel and Jozabad, the rulers of the Levites, contributed to the
Levites five thousand Passover victims, together with five hundred oxen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the service had been arranged, the priests
took their places, as did the Levites in their classes according to the king's
command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Passover sacrifice was slaughtered,
whereupon the priests sprinkled some of the blood and the Levites proceeded to
the skinning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They separated what was destined for the
holocaust and gave it to various groups of the ancestral houses of the common
people to offer to the LORD, as is prescribed in the book of Moses. They did
the same with the oxen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They cooked the Passover on the fire as
prescribed, and also cooked the sacred meals in pots, caldrons and pans, then
brought them quickly to all the common people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Afterward they prepared the Passover for
themselves and for the priests. Indeed the priests, the sons of Aaron, were
busy offering holocausts and the fatty portions until night; therefore the
Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The singers, the sons of Asaph, were at their
posts as prescribed by David: Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun, the king's seer. The
gatekeepers were at every gate; there was no need for them to leave their
stations, for their brethren, the Levites, prepared for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the entire service of the LORD was
arranged that day so that the Passover could be celebrated and the holocausts
offered on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had commanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites who were present on that
occasion kept the Passover and the feast of the Unleavened Bread for seven
days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No such Passover had been observed in Israel
since the time of the prophet Samuel, nor had any king of Israel kept a
Passover like that of Josiah, the priests and Levites, all of Judah and Israel
that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign
that this Passover was observed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After Josiah had done all this to restore the
temple, Neco, king of Egypt, came up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates,
and Josiah went out to intercept him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Neco sent messengers to him, saying: &quot;What
quarrel is between us, king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, for
my war is with another kingdom, and God has told me to hasten. Do not interfere
with God who is with me, as otherwise he will destroy you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Josiah would not withdraw from him, for he
had sought a pretext for fighting with him. Therefore he would not listen to
the words of Neco that came from the mouth of God, but went out to fight in the
plain of Megiddo. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the archers shot King Josiah, who said to
his servants, &quot;Take me away, for I am seriously wounded.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servants removed him from his own chariot,
placed him in another he had in reserve, and brought him to Jerusalem, where he
died. He was buried in the tombs of his ancestors, and all Judah and Jerusalem
mourned him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X6 href="__PBJ.HTM#$X6">1</a></sup></font></sup> Jeremiah also composed a lamentation over
Josiah, which is recited to this day by all the male and female singers in
their lamentations over Josiah. These have been made obligatory for Israel, and
can be found written in the Lamentations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the chronicle of Josiah, his pious
deeds in regard to what is written in the law of the LORD, and his acts, first
and last, can be found written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. </p>
