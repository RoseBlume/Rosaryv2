<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-S3 href="__P8P.HTM#$S3">1</a></sup></font></sup> King Solomon loved many foreign women besides
the daughter of Pharaoh (Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and
Hittites), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>from nations with which the LORD had forbidden
the Israelites to intermarry, &quot;because,&quot; he said, &quot;they will
turn your hearts to their gods.&quot; But Solomon fell in love with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had seven hundred wives of princely rank and
three hundred concubines, and his wives turned his heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Solomon was old his wives had turned his
heart to strange gods, and his heart was not entirely with the LORD, his God,
as the heart of his father David had been. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By adoring Astarte, the goddess of the
Sidonians, and Milcom, the idol of the Ammonites, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD; he
did not follow him unreservedly as his father David had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon then built a high place to Chemosh, the
idol of Moab, and to Molech, the idol of the Ammonites, on the hill opposite
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did the same for all his foreign wives who
burned incense and sacrificed to their gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD, therefore, became angry with Solomon,
because his heart was turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had
appeared to him twice </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(for though the LORD had forbidden him this
very act of following strange gods, Solomon had not obeyed him). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the LORD said to Solomon: &quot;Since this
is what you want, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes which I
enjoined on you, I will deprive you of the kingdom and give it to your servant.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will not do this during your lifetime,
however, for the sake of your father David; it is your son whom I will deprive.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nor will I take away the whole kingdom. I will
leave your son one tribe for the sake of my servant David and of Jerusalem,
which I have chosen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD then raised up an adversary to
Solomon: Hadad the Edomite, who was of the royal line in Edom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Earlier, when David had conquered Edom, Joab,
the general of the army, while going to bury the slain, put to death every male
in Edom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab and all Israel remained there six months
until they had killed off every male in Edom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, Hadad, who was only a boy, fled
toward Egypt with some Edomite servants of his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They left Midian and passing through Paran,
where they picked up additional men, they went into Egypt to Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, who gave Hadad a house, appointed him rations, and assigned him land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hadad won great favor with Pharaoh, so that he
gave him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tahpenes' sister bore Hadad a son, Genubath.
After his weaning, the queen kept him in Pharaoh's palace, where he then lived
with Pharaoh's own sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Hadad in Egypt heard that David rested
with his ancestors and that Joab, the general of the army, was dead, he said to
Pharaoh, &quot;Give me leave to return to my own country.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh said to him, &quot;What do you lack
with me, that you are seeking to return to your own country?&quot;
&quot;Nothing,&quot; he said, &quot;but please let me go!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God raised up against Solomon another adversary,
in Rezon, the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer, king of
Zobah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when David defeated them with slaughter. Rezon
gathered men about him and became leader of a band, went to Damascus, settled
there, and became king in Damascus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was an enemy of Israel as long as Solomon
lived; this added to the harm done by Hadad, who made a rift in Israel by
becoming king over Edom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon's servant Jeroboam, son of Nebat, an
Ephraimite from Zeredah with a widowed mother, Zeruah, also rebelled against
the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is why he rebelled. King Solomon was
building Millo, closing up the breach of his father's City of David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam was a man of means, and when Solomon
saw that he was also an industrious young man, he put him in charge of the
entire labor force of the house of Joseph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time Jeroboam left Jerusalem, and the
prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. The two were alone in the
area, and the prophet was wearing a new cloak. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahijah took off his new cloak, tore it into
twelve pieces, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to Jeroboam: &quot;Take ten pieces for
yourself; the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I will tear away the kingdom from
Solomon's grasp and will give you ten of the tribes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One tribe shall remain to him for the sake of
David my servant, and of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the
tribes of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The ten I will give you because he has forsaken
me and has worshiped Astarte, goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh, god of Moab,
and Milcom, god of the Ammonites; he has not followed my ways or done what is
pleasing to me according to my statutes and my decrees, as his father David
did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet I will not take any of the kingdom from
Solomon himself, but will keep him a prince as long as he lives for the sake of
my servant David, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I will take the kingdom from his son and
will give it to you - that is, the ten tribes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will give his son one tribe, that my servant
David may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city in which I choose
to be honored. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will take you; you shall reign over all that
you desire and shall become king of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, then, you heed all that I command you,
follow my ways, and please me by keeping my statutes and my commandments like
my servant David, I will be with you. I will establish for you, as I did for
David, a lasting dynasty; I will give Israel to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will punish David's line for this, but not
forever.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Solomon tried to have Jeroboam killed for
his rebellion, he escapedto King Shishak, in Egypt, where he remained until
Solomon's death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Solomon, with all his
deeds and his wisdom, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over
all Israel was forty years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon rested with his ancestors; he was
buried in his father's City of David, and his son Rehoboam succeeded him as
king. </p>

Solomon, his piety and wisdom, administrative skill and wealth, the extension
of his kingdom, his prestige among neighboring rulers, his reign of peace,
above all his friendship with God-these are now eclipsed by his sins of
intermarriage with great numbers of pagan wives and the consequent forbidden
worship of their gods (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P2F.HTM#PENT.EXO.34.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus 34:11-16;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4M.HTM#PENT.DEU.7.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 7:1-5). His construction of temples in their
honor merited the punishment of loss of a united kingdom to his posterity, and
the opposition of adversaries to himself (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8P.HTM#HIS.1KIN.11.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Kings
11:14, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8P.HTM#HIS.1KIN.11.23"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 23-37). Hadad the Edomite
rebelled against Solomon at the beginning of his reign (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P8P.HTM#HIS.1KIN.11.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1
Kings 11:25). Rezon of Syria established a new kingdom in Damascus;
Jeroboam of Israel constituted the greatest threat because of his revolt from
within. This threefold threat culminated in the breakup of Solomon's kingdom. </p>
