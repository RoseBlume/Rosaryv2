&quot;Give me children or I shall die!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In anger Jacob retorted, &quot;Can I take the

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4K href="__PW.HTM#$4K">2</a></sup></font></sup> So she gave him her maidservant Bilhah as a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Bilhah conceived and bore a son, </p>

Dan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rachel's maidservant Bilhah conceived again and

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Leah saw that she had ceased to bear
children, she gave her maidservant Zilpah to Jacob as a consort. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jacob had intercourse with Zilpah, and she

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4P href="__PW.HTM#$4P">7</a></sup></font></sup> One day, during the wheat harvest, when Reuben
was out in the field, he came upon some mandrakes which he brought home to his
mother Leah. Rachel asked Leah, &quot;Please let me have some of your son's
mandrakes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Leah replied, &quot;Was it not enough for you
to take away my husband, that you must now take my son's mandrakes too?&quot;
&quot;Very well, then!&quot; Rachel answered. &quot;In exchange for your son's
mandrakes, Jacob may lie with you tonight.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That evening, when Jacob came home from the
fields, Leah went out to meet him. &quot;You are now to come in with me,&quot;
she told him, &quot;because I have paid for you with my son's mandrakes.&quot;
So that night he slept with her, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and God heard her prayer; she conceived and
bore a fifth son to Jacob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4Q href="__PW.HTM#$4Q">8</a></sup></font></sup> Leah then said, &quot;God has given me my
reward for having let my husband have my maidservant&quot;; so she named him
Issachar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to
Jacob; </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4R href="__PW.HTM#$4R">9</a></sup></font></sup> and she said, &quot;God has brought me a
precious gift. This time my husband will offer me presents, now that I have
borne him six sons&quot;; so she named him Zebulun. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally, she gave birth to a daughter, and she
named her Dinah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then God remembered Rachel; he heard her prayer
and made her fruitful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She conceived and bore a son, and she said,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4S href="__PW.HTM#$4S">10</a></sup></font></sup> So she named him Joseph, meaning, &quot;May
the LORD add another son to this one for me!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said
to Laban: &quot;Give me leave to go to my homeland. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let me have my wives, for whom I served you,
and my children, too, that I may depart. You know very well the service that I
have rendered you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Laban answered him: &quot;If you will please...&quot;I
have learned through divination that it is because of you that God has blessed
me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So,&quot; he continued, &quot;state what wages
you want from me, and I will pay them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob replied: &quot;You know what work I did for
you and how well your livestock fared under my care; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the little you had before I came has grown into
very much, since the LORD'S blessings came upon you in my company. Therefore I
should now do something for my own household as well.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;What should I pay you?&quot; Laban asked.
Jacob answered: &quot;You do not have to pay me anything outright. I will again
pasture and tend your flock, if you do this one thing for me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4T href="__PW.HTM#$4T">11</a></sup></font></sup> go through your whole flock today and remove
from it every dark animal among the sheep and every spotted or speckled one
among the goats. Only such animals shall be my wages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the future, whenever you check on these wages
of mine, let my honesty testify against me: any animal in my possession that is
not a speckled or spotted goat, or a dark sheep, got there by theft!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Very well,&quot; agreed Laban. &quot;Let
it be as you say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4U href="__PW.HTM#$4U">12</a></sup></font></sup> That same day Laban removed the streaked and
spotted he-goats and all the speckled and spotted she-goats, all those with
some white on them, as well as the fully dark-colored sheep; these he left. . .
in charge of his sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he put a three days' journey between
himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to pasture the rest of Laban's flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob, however, got some fresh shoots of
poplar, almond and plane trees, and he made white stripes in them by peeling
off the bark down to the white core of the shoots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rods that he had thus peeled he then set
upright in the watering troughs, so that they would be in front of the animals
that drank from the troughs. When the animals were in heat as they came to
drink, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4V href="__PW.HTM#$4V">13</a></sup></font></sup> the goats mated by the rods, and so they
brought forth streaked, speckled and spotted kids. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The sheep, on the other hand, Jacob kept apart,
and he set these animals to face the streaked or fully dark-colored animals of
Laban. Thus he produced special flocks of his own, which he did not put with
Laban's flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, whenever the hardier animals were in
heat, Jacob would set the rods in the troughs in full view of these animals, so
that they mated by the rods; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but with the weaker animals he would not put
the rods there. So the feeble animals would go to Laban, but the sturdy ones to
Jacob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the man grew increasingly prosperous, and
he came to own not only large flocks but also male and female servants and
camels and asses. </p>

whittled stripes or bands or chevron marks were thought to cause the female
goats that looked at them to bear kids with lighter-colored marks on their dark
hair, while the gray ewes were thought to bear lambs with dark marks on them
simply by visual cross-breeding with the dark goats. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
