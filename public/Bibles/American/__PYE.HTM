</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the disturbance was over, Paul had the
disciples summoned and, after encouraging them, he bade them farewell and set
out on his journey to Macedonia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he traveled throughout those regions, he
provided many words of encouragement for them. Then he arrived in Greece, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>where he stayed for three months. But when a
plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he
decided to return by way of Macedonia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sopater, the son of Pyrrhus, from Beroea,
accompanied him, as did Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from
Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who went on ahead and waited for us <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-447 href="__PYE.HTM#$447">1</a></sup></font></sup>
at Troas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We sailed from Philippi after the feast of
Unleavened Bread, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-448 href="__PYE.HTM#$448">2</a></sup></font></sup> and rejoined them five days later in
Troas, where we spent a week. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the first day of the week <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-449 href="__PYE.HTM#$449">3</a></sup></font></sup>
when we gathered to break bread, Paul spoke to them because he was going to
leave on the next day, and he kept on speaking until midnight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were many lamps in the upstairs room
where we were gathered, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and a young man named Eutychus who was sitting
on the window sill was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. Once
overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and when he was picked up,
he was dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul went down, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44A href="__PYE.HTM#$44A">4</a></sup></font></sup> threw
himself upon him, and said as he embraced him, &quot;Don't be alarmed; there is
life in him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he returned upstairs, broke the bread, and
ate; after a long conversation that lasted until daybreak, he departed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And they took the boy away alive and were
immeasurably comforted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We went ahead to the ship and set sail for
Assos where we were to take Paul on board, as he had arranged, since he was
going overland. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and
went on to Mitylene. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We sailed away from there on the next day and
reached a point off Chios, and a day later we reached Samos, and on the
following day we arrived at Miletus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44B href="__PYE.HTM#$44B">5</a></sup></font></sup> Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus in order
not to lose time in the province of Asia, for he was hurrying to be in
Jerusalem, if at all possible, for the day of Pentecost. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From Miletus he had the presbyters of the
church at Ephesus summoned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they came to him, he addressed them,
&quot;You know how I lived among you the whole time from the day I first came
to the province of Asia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I served the Lord with all humility and with
the tears and trials that came to me because of the plots of the Jews, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and I did not at all shrink from telling you
what was for your benefit, or from teaching you in public or in your homes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I earnestly bore witness for both Jews and
Greeks to repentance before God and to faith in our Lord Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to
Jerusalem. What will happen to me there I do not know, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>except that in one city after another the holy
Spirit has been warning me that imprisonment and hardships await me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet I consider life of no importance to me, if
only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord
Jesus, to bear witness to the gospel of God's grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But now I know that none of you to whom I
preached the kingdom during my travels will ever see my face again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And so I solemnly declare to you this day that
I am not responsible for the blood of any of you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for I did not shrink from proclaiming to you
the entire plan of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Keep watch over yourselves and over the whole
flock of which the holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44C href="__PYE.HTM#$44C">6</a></sup></font></sup>
in which you tend the church of God that he acquired with his own blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I know that after my departure savage wolves
will come among you, and they will not spare the flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And from your own group, men will come forward
perverting the truth to draw the disciples away after them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So be vigilant and remember that for three
years, night and day, I unceasingly admonished each of you with tears. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now I commend you to God and to that
gracious word of his that can build you up and give you the inheritance among
all who are consecrated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have never wanted anyone's silver or gold or
clothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You know well that these very hands have served
my needs and my companions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In every way I have shown you that by hard work
of that sort we must help the weak, and keep in mind the words of the Lord
Jesus who himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had finished speaking he knelt down and
prayed with them all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were all weeping loudly as they threw
their arms around Paul and kissed him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for they were deeply distressed that he had
said that they would never see his face again. Then they escorted him to the
ship. </p>

dedication to the gospel (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYE.HTM#GOSP.ACT.20.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 20:18-21), speaks
