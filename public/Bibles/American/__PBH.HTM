<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became
king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, following
the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD had cleared out of the
way of the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He rebuilt the high places which his father
Hezekiah had torn down, erected altars for the Baals, made sacred poles, and
prostrated himself before the whole host of heaven and worshiped them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He even built altars in the temple of the LORD,
of which the LORD had said, &quot;In Jerusalem shall my name be forever&quot;: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he built altars to the whole host of heaven in
the two courts of the LORD'S house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was he, too, who immolated his sons by fire
in the Valley of
Ben-hinnom.
He practiced augury, divination and magic, and appointed necromancers and
diviners of spirits, so that he provoked the LORD with the great evil that he
did in his sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He placed an idol that he had carved in the
house of God, of which God had said to David and his son Solomon: &quot;In this
house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel I
shall place my name forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will not again allow Israel's feet to leave
the land which I assigned to your fathers, provided they are careful to observe
all that I commanded them, keeping the whole law and the statutes and the
ordinances given by Moses.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem into doing even greater evil than the nations which the LORD had
destroyed at the coming of the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but
they paid no attention. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X2 href="__PBH.HTM#$X2">1</a></sup></font></sup> Therefore the LORD brought against them the
army commanders of the Assyrian king; they took Manasseh with hooks, shackled
him with chains, and transported him to Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In this distress, he began to appease the LORD,
his God. He humbled himself abjectly before the God of his fathers </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X3 href="__PBH.HTM#$X3">2</a></sup></font></sup> and prayed to him. The LORD let himself be won
over: he heard his prayer and restored him to his kingdom in Jerusalem. Then
Manasseh understood that the LORD is indeed God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Afterward he built an outer wall for the City
of David to the west of Gihon in the valley, extending to the Fish Gate and
encircling Ophel; he built it very high. He stationed army officers in all the
fortified cities of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He removed the foreign gods and the idol from
the LORD'S house and all the altars he had built on the mount of the LORD'S
house and in Jerusalem, and he cast them outside the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He restored the altar of the LORD, and
sacrificed on it peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
serve the LORD, the God of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though the people continued to sacrifice on the
high places, they now did so to the LORD, their God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to
his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the LORD,
the God of Israel, can be found written in the chronicles of the kings of
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His prayer and how his supplication was heard,
all his sins and his infidelity, the sites where he built high places and
erected sacred poles and carved images before he humbled himself, all can be
found written down in the history of his seers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Manasseh rested with his ancestors and was
buried in his own palace. His son Amon succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became
king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as
his father Manasseh had done. Amon offered sacrifice to all the idols which his
father Manasseh had made, and worshiped them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, he did not humble himself before the
LORD as his father Manasseh had done; on the contrary, Amon only increased his
guilt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servants conspired against him and put him
to death in his own house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the people of the land slew all those who
had conspired against King Amon, and then they, the people of the land, made
his son Josiah king in his stead. </p>

for an imprisonment of King Manasseh in Babylon. However, according to the
Assyrian inscriptions, he paid tribute to the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon
(680-669 B.C.) and Asshurbanipal (668-627 B.C.). He may well have been obliged
to go to Nineveh to take the oath of allegiance as vassal to the king of
Assyria. </p>

in the public prayers of the Church.</p>
