<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3KG href="__PWR.HTM#-3KG">8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [22-56] This section records four
miracles of Jesus that manifest his power and authority: (1) the calming of a
storm on the lake (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWR.HTM#GOSP.LUK.8.22"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 8:22-25); (2) the exorcism
of a demoniac (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWR.HTM#GOSP.LUK.8.26"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 8:26-39); (3) the cure of a
hemorrhaging woman (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWR.HTM#GOSP.LUK.8.40"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 8:40-48); (4) the raising
of Jairus's daughter to life (49-56). They parallel the same sequence of
stories at <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PW6.HTM#GOSP.MAR.4.35"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark

in the area of pigs - unclean animals to Jews) and an indication that the person
who receives salvation (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWR.HTM#GOSP.LUK.8.36"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 8:36) is a Gentile.</p>

question reflects the popular belief that knowledge of the spirit's name
brought control over the spirit. Legion: to Jesus' question the demon replies
with a Latin word transliterated into Greek. The Roman legion at this period
consisted of 5,000 to 6,000 foot soldiers; hence the name implies a very large
number of demons.</p>

stories, one a healing and the other a resuscitation, present Jesus as master
over sickness and death. In the Lucan account, faith in Jesus is responsible
for the cure (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWR.HTM#GOSP.LUK.8.48"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 8:48) and for the raising to
