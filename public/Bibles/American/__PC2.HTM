<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When it had been reported to Sanballat, Tobiah,
Geshem the Arab, and our other enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and that
there was no breach left in it (though up to that time I had not yet set up the
doors in the gates), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message:
&quot;Come, let us hold council together at Caphirim in the plain of Ono.&quot;
They were planning to do me harm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, I sent messengers to them with this
reply: &quot;I am engaged in a great enterprise and am unable to come down; why
should the work stop, while I leave it to come down to you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Four times they sent me this same proposal, and
each time I gave the same reply. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent me the
same message by one of his servants, who bore an unsealed letter </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>containing this text: &quot;Among the nations
it has been reported - Geshem is witness to this - that you and the Jews are
planning a rebellion; that for this reason you are rebuilding the wall; and
that you are to be their king&quot; - and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Also, that you have set up prophets in
Jerusalem to proclaim you king of Judah. Now, since matters like these must
reach the ear of the king, come, let us hold council together.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I sent him this answer: &quot;Nothing of what
you report has taken place; rather, it is the invention of your own mind.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were all trying to frighten us, thinking,
&quot;Their hands will slacken in the work, and it will never be
completed.&quot; But instead, I now redoubled my efforts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I went to the house of Shemaiah, son of
Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was unable to go about, and he said: &quot;Let
us meet in the house of God, inside the temple building; let us lock the doors
of the temple. For men are coming to kill you; by night they are coming to kill
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My answer was: &quot;A man like me take flight?
Can a man like me enter the temple to save his life? I will not go!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For on consideration it was plain to me that
God had not sent him; rather, because Tobiah and Sanballat had bribed him, he
voiced this prophecy concerning me </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that I might act on it out of fear and commit
this sin. Then they would have had a shameful story with which to discredit me.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Keep in mind Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God,
because of these things they did; keep in mind as well Noadiah the prophetess
and the other prophets who were trying to frighten me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Y3 href="__PC2.HTM#$Y3">1</a></sup></font></sup> The wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day
of Elul; it had taken fifty-two days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all our enemies had heard of this, and all
the nations round about had taken note of it, our enemies lost much face in the
eyes of the nations, for they knew that it was with our God's help that this
work had been completed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Y4 href="__PC2.HTM#$Y4">2</a></sup></font></sup> At that same time, however, many letters were
going to Tobiah from the nobles of Judah, and Tobiah's letters were reaching
them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for many in Judah were in league with him,
since he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan
had married the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus they would praise his good deeds in my
presence and relate to him whatever I said; and Tobiah sent letters trying to
frighten me. </p>

8), the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem by Nehemiah took two years and
four months, which seems more probable. </p>
