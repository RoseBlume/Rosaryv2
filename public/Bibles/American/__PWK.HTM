<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I too have decided, after investigating

there was a priest named Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah; his wife
was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Both were righteous in the eyes of God,
observing all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they had no child, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3HA href="__PWK.HTM#$3HA">4</a></sup></font></sup>
because Elizabeth was barren and both were advanced in years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once when he was serving as priest in his
division's turn before God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>according to the practice of the priestly
service, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord to burn
incense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, when the whole assembly of the people was
praying outside at the hour of the incense offering, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing
at the right of the altar of incense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zechariah was troubled by what he saw, and fear
came upon him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the angel said to him, &quot;Do not be
afraid, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3HB href="__PWK.HTM#$3HB">5</a></sup></font></sup> Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard.
Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And you will have joy and gladness, and many
will rejoice at his birth, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15

Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3HC href="__PWK.HTM#$3HC">6</a></sup></font></sup> He will
be filled with the holy Spirit even from his mother's womb, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he will turn many of the children of Israel
to the Lord their God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will go before him in the spirit and power
of Elijah <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3HD href="__PWK.HTM#$3HD">7</a></sup></font></sup> to turn the hearts of fathers toward children
and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people
fit for the Lord.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Zechariah said to the angel, &quot;How
shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the angel said to him in reply, &quot;I am
Gabriel, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3HE href="__PWK.HTM#$3HE">8</a></sup></font></sup> who stand before God. I was sent to speak to you

did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah
and were amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when he came out, he was unable to speak to
them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was
gesturing to them but remained mute. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, when his days of ministry were completed,
he went home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived,

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;So has the Lord done for me at a time
when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3HG href="__PWK.HTM#$3HG">10</a></sup></font></sup> In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent
from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of
the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But she was greatly troubled at what was said
and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the angel said to her, &quot;Do not be

is the only one of the synoptic gospels to begin with a literary prologue.
Making use of a formal, literary construction and vocabulary, the author writes
the prologue in imitation of Hellenistic Greek writers and, in so doing,
relates his story about Jesus to contemporaneous Greek and Roman literature.
Luke is not only interested in the words and deeds of Jesus, but also in the
larger context of the birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus as the
fulfillment of the promises of God in the Old Testament. As a second- or
third-generation Christian, Luke acknowledges his debt to earlier eyewitnesses
and ministers of the word, but claims that his contribution to this developing
tradition is a complete and accurate account, told in an orderly anner, and
intended to provide Theophilus (&quot;friend of God,&quot; literally) and other
readers with certainty about earlier teachings they have received. </p>

Like the Gospel according to Matthew, this gospel opens with an infancy
narrative, a collection of stories about the birth and childhood of Jesus. The
narrative uses early Christian traditions about the birth of Jesus, traditions
about the birth and circumcision of John the Baptist, and canticles such as the
Magnificat (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWK.HTM#GOSP.LUK.1.46"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 1:46-55) and Benedictus

Greek Old Testament. It is largely, however, the composition of Luke who writes
in imitation of Old Testament birth stories, combining historical and legendary
details, literary ornamentation and interpretation of scripture, to answer in
advance the question, &quot;Who is Jesus Christ?&quot; The focus of the
narrative, therefore, is primarily christological. In this section Luke
announces many of the themes that will become prominent in the rest of the
gospel: the centrality of Jerusalem and the temple, the journey motif, the
universality of salvation, joy and peace, concern for the lowly, the importance
of women, the presentation of Jesus as savior, Spirit-guided revelation and
prophecy, and the fulfillment of Old Testament promises. The account presents
parallel scenes (diptychs) of angelic announcements of the birth of John the
Baptist and of Jesus, and of the birth, circumcision, and presentation of John
and Jesus. In this parallelism, the ascendency of Jesus over John is stressed:

believer in the infancy narrative should be seen in connection with the
explicit mention of her presence among &quot;those who believed&quot; after the
resurrection at the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles

for being the mother of the Lord and because of her belief, she reacts as the
servant in a psalm of praise, the Magnificat. Because there is no specific
connection of the canticle to the context of Mary's pregnancy and her visit to
Elizabeth, the Magnificat (with the possible exception of v 48) may have been a
Jewish Christian hymn that Luke found appropriate at this point in his story.
Even if not composed by Luke, it fits in well with themes found elsewhere in
Luke: joy and exultation in the Lord; the lowly being singled out for God's
favor; the reversal of human fortunes; the fulfillment of Old Testament
promises. The loose connection between the hymn and the context is further seen
in the fact that a few Old Latin manuscripts identify the speaker of the hymn
as Elizabeth, even though the overwhelming textual evidence makes Mary the
speaker.</p>

play crucial roles in the inauguration of Christianity to be wholly a part of
the people of Israel. At the end of the Acts of the Apostles
