<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites offended the LORD, who therefore
delivered them into the power of Midian for seven years, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so that Midian held Israel subject. For fear of
Midian the Israelites established the fire signals on the mountains, the caves
for refuge, and the strongholds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And it used to be that when the Israelites had
completed their sowing, Midian, Amalek and the Kedemites would come up, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>encamp opposite them, and destroy the produce
of the land as far as the outskirts of Gaza, leaving no sustenance in Israel,
nor sheep, oxen or asses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For they would come up with their livestock,
and their tents would become as numerous as locusts; and neither they nor their
camels could be numbered, when they came into the land to lay it waste. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus was Israel reduced to misery by Midian,
and so the Israelites cried out to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Israel cried out to the LORD because of
Midian, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he sent a prophet to the Israelites who said to
them, &quot;The LORD, the God of Israel, says: I led you up from Egypt; I
brought you out of the place of slavery. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I rescued you from the power of Egypt and of
all your other oppressors. I drove them out before you and gave you their land.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And I said to you: I, the LORD, am your God; you
shall not venerate the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But
you did not obey me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the angel of the LORD came and sat under
the terebinth in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite. While his son
Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to save it from the Midianites, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said,
&quot;The LORD is with you, O champion!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;My Lord,&quot; Gideon said to him,
&quot;if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are his
wondrous deeds of which our fathers told us when they said, 'Did not the LORD
bring us up from Egypt?' For now the LORD has abandoned us and has delivered us
into the power of Midian.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD turned to him and said, &quot;Go with
the strength you have and save Israel from the power of Midian. It is I who
send you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he answered him, &quot;Please, my lord, how
can I save Israel? My family is the meanest in Manasseh, and I am the most
insignificant in my father's house.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I shall be with you,&quot; the LORD said
to him, &quot;and you will cut down Midian to the last man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He answered him, &quot;If I find favor with
you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not depart from here, I pray you, until I
come back to you and bring out my offering and set it before you.&quot; He
answered, &quot;I will await your return.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Gideon went off and prepared a kid and an
ephah of flour in the form of unleavened cakes. Putting the meat in a basket
and the broth in a pot, he brought them out to him under the terebinth and
presented them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The angel of God said to him, &quot;Take the
meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock; then pour out the
broth.&quot; When he had done so, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the angel of the LORD stretched out the tip of
the staff he held, and touched the meat and unleavened cakes. Thereupon a fire
came up from the rock which consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the
angel of the LORD disappeared from sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon, now aware that it had been the angel of
the LORD, said, &quot;Alas, Lord GOD, that I have seen the angel of the LORD
face to face!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD answered him, &quot;Be calm, do not
fear. You shall not die.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MS href="__P69.HTM#$MS">1</a></sup></font></sup> So Gideon built there an altar to the LORD and
called it Yahweh-shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MT href="__P69.HTM#$MT">2</a></sup></font></sup> That same night the LORD said to him,
&quot;Take the seven-year-old spare bullock and destroy your father's altar to
Baal and cut down the sacred pole that is by it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall build, instead, the proper kind of
altar to the LORD, your God, on top of this stronghold. Then take the spare
bullock and offer it as a holocaust on the wood from the sacred pole you have
cut down.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as
the LORD had commanded him. But through fear of his family and of the
townspeople, he would not do it by day, but did it at night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning the townspeople found
that the altar of Baal had been destroyed, the sacred pole near it cut down,
and the spare bullock offered on the altar that was built. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They asked one another, &quot;Who did
this?&quot; Their inquiry led them to the conclusion that Gideon, son of Joash,
had done it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the townspeople said to Joash, &quot;Bring
out your son that he may die, for he has destroyed the altar of Baal and has
cut down the sacred pole that was near it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Joash replied to all who were standing
around him, &quot;Do you intend to act in Baal's stead, or be his champion? If
anyone acts for him, he shall be put to death by morning. If he whose altar has
been destroyed is a god, let him act for himself!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MU href="__P69.HTM#$MU">3</a></sup></font></sup> So on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal,
because of the words, &quot;Let Baal take action against him, since he
destroyed his altar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all Midian and Amalek and the Kedemites
mustered and crossed over into the valley of Jezreel, where they encamped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The spirit of the LORD enveloped Gideon; he
blew the horn that summoned Abiezer to follow him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent messengers, too, throughout Manasseh,
which also obeyed his summons; through Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, likewise,
he sent messengers and these tribes advanced to meet the others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon said to God, &quot;If indeed you are
going to save Israel through me, as you promised, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am putting this woolen fleece on the
threshing floor. If dew comes on the fleece alone, while all the ground is dry,
I shall know that you will save Israel through me, as you promised.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That is what took place. Early the next morning
he wrung the dew from the fleece, squeezing out of it a bowlful of water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Gideon then said to God, &quot;Do not be angry
with me if I speak once more. Let me make just one more test with the fleece.
Let the fleece alone be dry, but let there be dew on all the ground.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>That night God did so; the fleece alone was
dry, but there was dew on all the ground. </p>
