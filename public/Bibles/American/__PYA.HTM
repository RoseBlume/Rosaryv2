<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He reached (also) Derbe and Lystra where there
was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but
his father was a Greek. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke highly
of him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Paul wanted him to come along with him. On
account of the Jews of that region, Paul had him circumcised, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-439 href="__PYA.HTM#$439">1</a></sup></font></sup>
for they all knew that his father was a Greek. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they traveled from city to city, they handed
on to the people for observance the decisions reached by the apostles and
presbyters in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Day after day the churches grew stronger in
faith and increased in number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They traveled through the Phrygian and Galatian
territory because they had been prevented by the holy Spirit from preaching the
message in the province of Asia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they came to Mysia, they tried to go on
into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43A href="__PYA.HTM#$43A">2</a></sup></font></sup> did not allow them,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so they crossed through Mysia and came down to
Troas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During (the) night Paul had a vision. A
Macedonian stood before him and implored him with these words, &quot;Come over
to Macedonia and help us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had seen the vision, we <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43B href="__PYA.HTM#$43B">3</a></sup></font></sup>
sought passage to Macedonia at once, concluding that God had called us to
proclaim the good news to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43C href="__PYA.HTM#$43C">4</a></sup></font></sup> We set sail from Troas, making a straight run
for Samothrace, and on the next day to Neapolis, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and from there to Philippi, a leading city in
that district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We spent some time in that city.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the sabbath we went outside the city gate
along the river where we thought there would be a place of prayer. We sat and
spoke with the women who had gathered there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of them, a woman named Lydia, a dealer in
purple cloth, from the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43D href="__PYA.HTM#$43D">5</a></sup></font></sup>
listened, and the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what Paul was
saying. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After she and her household had been baptized,
she offered us an invitation, &quot;If you consider me a believer in the Lord,
come and stay at my home,&quot; and she prevailed on us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As we were going to the place of prayer, we met
a slave girl with an oracular spirit, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43E href="__PYA.HTM#$43E">6</a></sup></font></sup> who used to bring a large
profit to her owners through her fortune-telling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She began to follow Paul and us, shouting,
&quot;These people are slaves of the Most High God, who proclaim to you a way
of salvation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She did this for many days. Paul became
annoyed, turned, and said to the spirit, &quot;I command you in the name of
Jesus Christ to come out of her.&quot; Then it came out at that moment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When her owners saw that their hope of profit
was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the public square
before the local authorities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They brought them before the magistrates <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43F href="__PYA.HTM#$43F">7</a></sup></font></sup>
and said, &quot;These people are Jews and are disturbing our city </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and are advocating customs that are not lawful
for us Romans to adopt or practice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The crowd joined in the attack on them, and the
magistrates had them stripped and ordered them to be beaten with rods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After inflicting many blows on them, they threw
them into prison and instructed the jailer to guard them securely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he received these instructions, he put
them in the innermost cell and secured their feet to a stake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About midnight, while Paul and Silas were
praying and singing hymns to God as the prisoners listened, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>there was suddenly such a severe earthquake
that the foundations of the jail shook; all the doors flew open, and the chains
of all were pulled loose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the jailer woke up and saw the prison
doors wide open, he drew (his) sword and was about to kill himself, thinking
that the prisoners had escaped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Paul shouted out in a loud voice, &quot;Do
no harm to yourself; we are all here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He asked for a light and rushed in and,
trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he brought them out and said, &quot;Sirs,
what must I do to be saved?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And they said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus
and you and your household will be saved.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they spoke the word of the Lord to him and
to everyone in his house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He took them in at that hour of the night and
bathed their wounds; then he and all his family were baptized at once. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He brought them up into his house and provided
a meal and with his household rejoiced at having come to faith in God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when it was day, the magistrates sent the
lictors <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43G href="__PYA.HTM#$43G">8</a></sup></font></sup> with the order, &quot;Release those men.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The jailer reported the (se) words to Paul,
&quot;The magistrates have sent orders that you be released. Now, then, come
out and go in peace.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Paul said to them, &quot;They have beaten
us publicly, even though we are Roman citizens and have not been tried, and
have thrown us into prison. And now, are they going to release us secretly? By
no means. Let them come themselves and lead us out.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-43H href="__PYA.HTM#$43H">9</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The lictors reported these words to the
magistrates, and they became alarmed when they heard that they were Roman
citizens. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they came and placated them, and led them
out and asked that they leave the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had come out of the prison, they went
to Lydia's house where they saw and encouraged the brothers, and then they
left. </p>

did this in order that Timothy might be able to associate with the Jews and so
perform a ministry among them. Paul did not object to the Jewish Christians'
adherence to the law. But he insisted that the law could not be imposed on the
Gentiles. Paul himself lived in accordance with the law, or as exempt from the
law, according to particular circumstances (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PZE.HTM#NTLET.1COR.9.19"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Cor

so-called &quot;we-sections&quot; in Acts, where Luke writes as one of Paul's
companions. The other passages are <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYE.HTM#GOSP.ACT.20.5"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 20:5-15;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYF.HTM#GOSP.ACT.21.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 21:1-18; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYL.HTM#GOSP.ACT.27.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 27:1-<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYM.HTM#GOSP.ACT.28.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 28:16.
Scholars debate whether Luke may not have used the first person plural simply
as a literary device to lend color to the narrative. The realism of the
narrative, however, lends weight to the argument that the &quot;we&quot;
includes Luke or another companion of Paul whose data Luke used as a source.</p>
