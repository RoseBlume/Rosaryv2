<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 8</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now when the seventh month came, the whole
people gathered as one man in the open space before the Water Gate, and they
called upon Ezra the scribe to bring forth the book of the law of Moses which
the LORD prescribed for Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the first day of the seventh month,
therefore, Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, which consisted
of men, women, and those children old enough to understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Standing at one end of the open place that was
before the Water Gate, he read out of the book from daybreak till midday, in
the presence of the men, the women, and those children old enough to
understand; and all the people listened attentively to the book of the law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that
had been made for the occasion; at his right side stood Mattithiah, Shema,
Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, and on his left Pedaiah, Mishael,
Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, Meshullam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ezra opened the scroll so that all the people
might see it (for he was standing higher up than any of the people); and, as he
opened it, all the people rose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all
the people, their hands raised high, answered, &quot;Amen, amen!&quot; Then
they bowed down and prostrated themselves before the LORD, their faces to the
ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The Levites Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin,
Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and
Pelaiah explained the law to the people, who remained in their places.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ezra read plainly from the book of the law of
God, interpreting it so that all could understand what was read. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then (Nehemiah, that is, His Excellency, and)
Ezra the priest-scribe (and the Levites who were instructing the people) said
to all the people: &quot;Today is holy to the LORD your God. Do not be sad, and
do not weep&quot;-for all the people were weeping as they heard the words of
the law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said further: &quot;Go, eat rich foods and
drink sweet drinks, and allot portions to those who had nothing prepared; for
today is holy to our LORD. Do not be saddened this day, for rejoicing in the
LORD must be your strength!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(And the Levites quieted all the people,
saying, &quot;Hush, for today is holy, and you must not be saddened.&quot;) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then all the people went to eat and drink, to
distribute portions, and to celebrate with great joy, for they understood the
words that had been expounded to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the second day, the family heads of the
whole people and also the priests and the Levites gathered around Ezra the
scribe and examined the words of the law more closely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They found it written in the law prescribed by
the LORD through Moses that the Israelites must dwell in booths during the
feast of the seventh month; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and that they should have this proclamation
made throughout their cities and in Jerusalem: &quot;Go out into the hill
country and bring in branches of olive trees, oleasters, myrtle, palm, and
other leafy trees, to make booths, as the law prescribes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people went out and brought in branches
with which they made booths for themselves, on the roof of their houses, in
their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, and in the open spaces of
the Water Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the entire assembly of the returned exiles
made booths and dwelt in them. Now the Israelites had done nothing of this sort
from the days of Jeshua, son of Nun, until this occasion; therefore there was
very great joy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ezra read from the book of the law of God day
after day, from the first day to the last. They kept the feast for seven days,
and the solemn assembly on the eighth day, as was required. </p>
