<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 4</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the
Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of
Jerusalem was progressing - for the gaps were beginning to be closed up - they
became extremely angry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon they all plotted together to come and
fight against Jerusalem and thus to throw us into confusion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We prayed to our God and posted a watch against
them day and night for fear of what they might do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile the Judahites were saying:
&quot;Slackened is the bearers' strength, there is no end to the rubbish; Never
shall we be able the wall to rebuild.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Our enemies thought, &quot;Before they are
aware of it or see us, we shall come into their midst, kill them, and put an
end to the work.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Jews who lived near them had come to
us from one place after another, and had told us ten times over that they were
about to attack us, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I stationed guards down below, behind the wall,
near the exposed points, assigning them by family groups with their swords,
their spears, and their bows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I made an inspection, then addressed these
words to the nobles, the magistrates, and the rest of the people: &quot;Have no
fear of them! Keep in mind the LORD, who is great and to be feared, and fight
for your brethren, your sons and daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When our enemies became aware that we had been
warned and that God had upset their plan, we all went back, each to his own
task at the wall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From that time on, however, only half my able
men took a hand in the work, while the other half, armed with spears, bucklers,
bows, and breastplates, stood guard behind the whole house of Judah </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as they rebuilt the wall. The load carriers,
too, were armed; each did his work with one hand and held a weapon with the
other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Every builder, while he worked, had his sword
girt at his side. Also, a trumpeter stood beside me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for I had said to the nobles, the magistrates,
and the rest of the people: &quot;Our work is scattered and extensive, and we
are widely separated from one another along the wall; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>wherever you hear the trumpet sound, join us
there; our God will fight with us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus we went on with the work, half of the men
with spears at the ready, from daybreak till the stars came out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the same time I told the people to spend the
nights inside Jerusalem, each man with his own attendant, so that they might
serve as a guard by night and a working force by day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Neither I, nor my kinsmen, nor any of my
attendants, nor any of the bodyguard that accompanied me took off his clothes;
everyone kept his weapon at his right hand. </p>
