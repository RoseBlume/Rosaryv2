</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QS href="__P80.HTM#$QS">1</a></sup></font></sup> At the turn of the year, when kings go out on
campaign, David sent out Joab along with his officers and the army of Israel,
and they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. David, however, remained in
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One evening David rose from his siesta and
strolled about on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing,
who was very beautiful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David had inquiries made about the woman and
was told, &quot;She is Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, and wife of (Joab's
armor-bearer) Uriah the Hittite.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David sent messengers and took her. When
she came to him, he had relations with her, at a time when she was just
purified after her monthly period. She then returned to her house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the woman had conceived, and sent the
information to David, &quot;I am with child.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David therefore sent a message to Joab,
&quot;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&quot; So Joab sent Uriah to David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he came, David questioned him about Joab,
the soldiers, and how the war was going, and Uriah answered that all was well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then said to Uriah, &quot;Go down to your
house and bathe your feet.&quot; Uriah left the palace, and a portion was sent
out after him from the king's table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Uriah slept at the entrance of the royal
palace with the other officers of his lord, and did not go down to his own
house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David was told that Uriah had not gone home. So
he said to Uriah, &quot;Have you not come from a journey? Why, then, did you
not go down to your house?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Uriah answered David, &quot;The ark and Israel
and Judah are lodged in tents, and my lord Joab and your majesty's servants are
encamped in the open field. Can I go home to eat and to drink and to sleep with
my wife? As the LORD lives and as you live, I will do no such thing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David said to Uriah, &quot;Stay here today
also, I shall dismiss you tomorrow.&quot; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that
day. On the day following, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David summoned him, and he ate and drank with
David, who made him drunk. But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed
among his lord's servants, and did not go down to his home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab
which he sent by Uriah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In it he directed: &quot;Place Uriah up front,
where the fighting is fierce. Then pull back and leave him to be struck down
dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So while Joab was besieging the city, he
assigned Uriah to a place where he knew the defenders were strong. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the men of the city made a sortie against
Joab, some officers of David's army fell, and among them Uriah the Hittite
died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joab sent David a report of all the
details of the battle, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>instructing the messenger, &quot;When you have
finished giving the king all the details of the battle, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king may become angry and say to you: 'Why
did you go near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from
the wall above? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Who killed Abimelech, son of Jerubbaal? Was it
not a woman who threw a millstone down on him from the wall above, so that he
died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?' Then you in turn shall say,
'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QT href="__P80.HTM#$QT">2</a></sup></font></sup> The messenger set out, and on his arrival he
relayed to David all the details as Joab had instructed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He told David: &quot;The men had us at a
disadvantage and came out into the open against us, but we pushed them back to
the entrance of the city gate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the archers shot at your servants from the
wall above, and some of the king's servants died, among them your servant
Uriah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to the messenger: &quot;This is what
you shall convey to Joab: 'Do not be chagrined at this, for the sword devours
now here and now there. Strengthen your attack on the city and destroy it.'
Encourage him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the wife of Uriah heard that her husband
had died, she mourned her lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But once the mourning was over, David sent for
her and brought her into his house. She became his wife and bore him a son. But
the LORD was displeased with what David had done. </p>
