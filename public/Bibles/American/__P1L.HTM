<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But,&quot; objected Moses, &quot;suppose
they will not believe me, nor listen to my plea? For they may say, 'The LORD
did not appear to you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD therefore asked him, &quot;What is
that in your hand?&quot; &quot;A staff,&quot; he answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD then said, &quot;Throw it on the
ground.&quot; When he threw it on the ground it was changed into a serpent, and
Moses shied away from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now, put out your hand,&quot; the LORD
said to him, &quot;and take hold of its tail.&quot; So he put out his hand and
laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This will take place so that they may
believe,&quot; he continued, &quot;that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, did appear to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again the LORD said to him, &quot;Put your hand
in your bosom.&quot; He put it in his bosom, and when he withdrew it, to his
surprise his hand was leprous, like snow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD then said, &quot;Now, put your hand
back in your bosom.&quot; Moses put his hand back in his bosom, and when he
withdrew it, to his surprise it was again like the rest of his body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If they will not believe you, nor heed
the message of the first sign, they should believe the message of the second. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And if they will not believe even these two
signs, nor heed your plea, take some water from the river and pour it on the
dry land. The water you take from the river will become blood on the dry
land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses, however, said to the LORD, &quot;If you
please, LORD, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past, nor recently,
nor now that you have spoken to your servant; but I am slow of speech and
tongue.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to him, &quot;Who gives one man
speech and makes another deaf and dumb? Or who gives sight to one and makes
another blind? Is it not I, the LORD? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Go, then! It is I who will assist you in
speaking and will teach you what you are to say.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7I href="__P1L.HTM#$7I">1</a></sup></font></sup> Yet he insisted, &quot;If you please, Lord,
send someone else!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD became angry with Moses and said,
&quot;Have you not your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know that he is an
eloquent speaker. Besides, he is now on his way to meet you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he sees you, his heart will be glad. You
are to speak to him, then, and put the words in his mouth. I will assist both
you and him in speaking and will teach the two of you what you are to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7J href="__P1L.HTM#$7J">2</a></sup></font></sup> He shall speak to the people for you: he shall
be your spokesman, and you shall be as God to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7K href="__P1L.HTM#$7K">3</a></sup></font></sup> Take this staff in your hand; with it you are
to perform the signs.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7L href="__P1L.HTM#$7L">4</a></sup></font></sup> After this Moses returned to his father-in-law
Jethro and said to him, &quot;Let me go back, please, to my kinsmen in Egypt,
to see whether they are still living.&quot; Jethro replied, &quot;Go in
peace.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Midian the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Go back
to Egypt, for all the men who sought your life are dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Moses took his wife and his sons, and
started back to the land of Egypt, with them riding the ass. The staff of God
he carried with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7M href="__P1L.HTM#$7M">5</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD said to him, &quot;On your return to
Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have put in your
power. I will make him obstinate, however, so that he will not let the people
go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So you shall say to Pharaoh: Thus says the
LORD: Israel is my son, my first-born. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hence I tell you: Let my son go, that he may
serve me. If you refuse to let him go, I warn you, I will kill your son, your
first-born.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7N href="__P1L.HTM#$7N">6</a></sup></font></sup> On the journey, at a place where they spent
the night, the Lord came upon Moses and would have killed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Zipporah took a piece of flint and cut off
her son's foreskin and, touching his person, she said, &quot;You are a spouse
of blood to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then God let Moses go. At that time she said,
&quot;A spouse of blood,&quot; in regard to the circumcision. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Aaron, &quot;Go into the
desert to meet Moses.&quot; So he went, and when they met at the mountain of
God, Aaron kissed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses informed him of all the LORD had said in
sending him, and of the various signs he had enjoined upon him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the
elders of the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to
Moses, and he performed the signs before the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people believed, and when they heard that
the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their affliction, they bowed
down in worship. </p>
