<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 13</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some time later the following incident
occurred. David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and David's
son Amnon loved her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was in such straits over his sister Tamar
that he became sick; since she was a virgin, Amnon thought it impossible to
carry out his designs toward her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, son of
David's brother Shimeah, who was very clever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He asked him, &quot;Prince, why are you so
dejected morning after morning? Why not tell me?&quot; So Amnon said to him,
&quot;I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jonadab replied, &quot;Lie down on your
bed and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to visit you, say to him,
'Please let my sister Tamar come and encourage me to take food. If she prepares
something appetizing in my presence, for me to see, I will eat it from her
hand.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick.
When the king came to visit him, Amnon said to the king, &quot;Please let my
sister Tamar come and prepare some fried cakes before my eyes, that I may take
nourishment from her hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then sent home a message to Tamar,
&quot;Please go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some nourishment
for him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon,
who was in bed. Taking dough and kneading it, she twisted it into cakes before
his eyes and fried the cakes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then she took the pan and set out the cakes
before him. But Amnon would not eat; he said, &quot;Have everyone leave
me.&quot; When they had all left him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Amnon said to Tamar, &quot;Bring the
nourishment into the bedroom, that I may have it from your hand.&quot; So Tamar
picked up the cakes she had prepared and brought them to her brother Amnon in
the bedroom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when she brought them to him to eat, he
seized her and said to her, &quot;Come! Lie with me, my sister!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But she answered him, &quot;No my brother! Do
not shame me! That is an intolerable crime in Israel. Do not commit this
insensate deed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Where would I take my shame? And you would be a
discredited man in Israel. So please, speak to the king; he will not keep me
from you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Not heeding her plea, he overpowered her; he
shamed her and had relations with her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Amnon conceived an intense hatred for her,
which far surpassed the love he had had for her. &quot;Get up and leave,&quot;
he said to her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She replied, &quot;No, brother, because to
drive me out would be far worse than the first injury you have done me.&quot;
He would not listen to her, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but called the youth who was his attendant and
said, &quot;Put her outside, away from me, and bar the door after her.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now she had on a long tunic, for that is how
maiden princesses dressed in olden days. When his attendant put her out and
barred the door after her, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long
tunic in which she was clothed. Then, putting her hands to her head, she went
away crying loudly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Her brother Absalom said to her: &quot;Has your
brother Amnon been with you? Be still now, my sister; he is your brother. Do
not take this affair to heart.&quot; But Tamar remained grief-stricken and
forlorn in the house of her brother Absalom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King David, who got word of the whole affair,
became very angry. He did not, however, spark the resentment of his son Amnon,
whom he favored because he was his first-born. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom, moreover, said nothing at all to
Amnon, although he hated him for having shamed his sister Tamar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After a period of two years, Absalom had
shearers in Baalhazor near Ephraim, and he invited all the princes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom went to the king and said: &quot;Your
servant is having shearers. Please, your majesty, come with all your retainers
to your servant.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the King said to Absalom, &quot;No, my son,
all of us should not go lest we be a burden to you.&quot; And though Absalom
urged him, he refused to go and began to bid him good-bye. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom then said, &quot;If you will not come
yourself, please let my brother Amnon come to us.&quot; The king asked him,
&quot;Why should he go to you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At Absalom's urging, however, he sent Amnon and
all the other princes with him. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for royalty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he had instructed his servants: &quot;Now
watch! When Amnon is merry with wine and I say to you, 'Kill Amnon,' put him to
death. Do not be afraid, for it is I who order you to do it. Be resolute and
act manfully.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the servants did to Amnon as Absalom had
commanded, all the other princes rose, mounted their mules, and fled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While they were still on the road, a report
reached David that Absalom had killed all the princes and that not one of them
had survived. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king stood up, rent his garments, and then
lay on the ground. All his servants standing by him also rent their garments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jonadab, son of David's brother Shimeah,
spoke up: &quot;Let not my lord think that all the young princes have been
killed! Amnon alone is dead, for Absalom was determined on this ever since
Amnon shamed his sister Tamar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So let not my lord the king put faith in the
report that all the princes are dead. Amnon alone is dead.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, Absalom had taken flight. Then the
servant on watch looked about and saw a large group coming down the slope from
the direction of Bahurim. He came in and reported this, telling the king that
he had seen some men coming down the mountainside from the direction of
Bahurim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jonadab said to the king: &quot;There! The
princes have come. It is as your servant said.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No sooner had he finished speaking than the
princes came in, weeping aloud. The king, too, and all his servants wept very
bitterly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Absalom, who had taken flight, went to
Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and stayed in Geshur for three years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king continued during all that time to
mourn over his son; but his longing reached out for Absalom as he became
reconciled to the death of Amnon. </p>
