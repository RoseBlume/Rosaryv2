<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-69 href="__P1A.HTM#$69">1</a></sup></font></sup> Then Joseph gave his head steward these
instructions: &quot;Fill the men's bags with as much food as they can carry,
and put each man's money in the mouth of his bag. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the mouth of the youngest one's bag put also
my silver goblet, together with the money for his rations.&quot; The steward
carried out Joseph's instructions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At daybreak the men and their donkeys were sent
off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They had not gone far out of the city when
Joseph said to his head steward: &quot;Go at once after the men! When you
overtake them, say to them, 'Why did you repay good with evil? Why did you
steal the silver goblet from me? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6A href="__P1A.HTM#$6A">2</a></sup></font></sup> It is the very one from which my master drinks
and which he uses for divination. What you have done is wrong.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the steward overtook them and repeated
these words to them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they remonstrated with him: &quot;How can my
lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We even brought back to you from the land of
Canaan the money that we found in the mouths of our bags. Why, then, would we
steal silver or gold from your master's house? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If any of your servants is found to have the
goblet, he shall die, and as for the rest of us, we shall become my lord's
slaves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he replied, &quot;Even though it ought to
be as you propose, only the one who is found to have it shall become my slave,
and the rest of you shall be exonerated.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then each of them eagerly lowered his bag to
the ground and opened it; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and when a search was made, starting with the
oldest and ending with the youngest, the goblet turned up in Benjamin's bag. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this, they tore their clothes. Then, when each
man had reloaded his donkey, they returned to the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Judah and his brothers reentered Joseph's
house, he was still there; so they flung themselves on the ground before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;How could you do such a thing?&quot;
Joseph asked them. &quot;You should have known that such a man as I could
discover by divination what happened.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6B href="__P1A.HTM#$6B">3</a></sup></font></sup> Judah replied: &quot;What can we say to my
lord? How can we plead or how try to prove our innocence? God has uncovered
your servants' guilt. Here we are, then, the slaves of my lord - the rest of us
no less than the one in whose possession the goblet was found.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Far be it from me to act thus!&quot; said
Joseph. &quot;Only the one in whose possession the goblet was found shall
become my slave; the rest of you may go back safe and sound to your
father.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah then stepped up to him and said: &quot;I
beg you, my lord, let your servant speak earnestly to my lord, and do not
become angry with your servant, for you are the equal of Pharaoh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6C href="__P1A.HTM#$6C">4</a></sup></font></sup> My lord asked your servants, 'Have you a
father, or another brother?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So we said to my lord, 'We have an aged father,
and a young brother, the child of his old age. This one's full brother is dead,
and since he is the only one by that mother who is left, his father dotes on
him.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then you told your servants, 'Bring him down to
me that my eyes may look on him.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We replied to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave
his father; his father would die if he were to leave him.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you told your servants, 'Unless your
youngest brother comes back with you, you shall not come into my presence
again.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When we returned to your servant our father, we
reported to him the words of my lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Later, our father told us to come back
and buy some food for the family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So we reminded him, 'We cannot go down there;
only if our youngest brother is with us can we go, for we may not see the man
if our youngest brother is not with us.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then your servant our father said to us, 'As
you know, my wife bore me two sons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of them, however, disappeared, and I had to
conclude that he must have been torn to pieces by wild beasts; I have not seen
him since. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you now take this one away from me too, and
some disaster befalls him, you will send my white head down to the nether world
in grief.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If then the boy is not with us when I go
back to your servant my father, whose very life is bound up with his, he will
die as soon as he sees that the boy is missing; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and your servants will thus send the white head
of our father down to the nether world in grief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Besides, I, your servant, got the boy from his
father by going surety for him, saying, 'If I fail to bring him back to you,
father, you can hold it against me forever.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let me, your servant, therefore, remain in
place of the boy as the slave of my lord, and let the boy go back with his
brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How could I go back to my father if the boy
were not with me? I could not bear to see the anguish that would overcome my
father.&quot; </p>
