<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Before David and his men reached Ziklag on the
third day, the Amalekites had raided the Negeb and Ziklag, had stormed the
city, and had set it on fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They had taken captive the women and all who
were in the city, young and old, killing no one; they had carried them off when
they left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David and his men arrived at the city to find
it burned to the ground and their wives, sons and daughters taken captive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David and those who were with him wept
aloud until they could weep no more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David's two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and
Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel, had also been carried off with the
rest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now David found himself in great difficulty,
for the men spoke of stoning him, so bitter were they over the fate of their
sons and daughters. But with renewed trust in the LORD his God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to Abiathar, the priest, son of
Ahimelech, &quot;Bring me the ephod!&quot; When Abiathar brought him the ephod,
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David inquired of the LORD, &quot;Shall I
pursue these raiders? Can I overtake them?&quot; The LORD answered him,
&quot;Go in pursuit, for you shall surely overtake them and effect a
rescue.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David went off with his six hundred men and
came as far as the Wadi Besor, where those who were to remain behind halted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David continued the pursuit with four hundred
men, but two hundred were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor and remained
behind. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>An Egyptian was found in the open country and
brought to David. He was provided with food, which he ate, and given water to
drink; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of pressed
raisins were also offered to him. When he had eaten, he revived; he had not
taken food nor drunk water for three days and three nights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David asked him, &quot;To whom do you
belong, and where do you come from?&quot; He replied: &quot;I am an Egyptian,
the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me because I fell sick three
days ago today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We raided the Negeb of the Cherethites, the
territory of Judah, and the Negeb of Caleb; and we set Ziklag on fire.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David then asked him, &quot;Will you lead me
down to this raiding party?&quot; He answered, &quot;Swear to me by God that
you will not kill me or deliver me to my master, and I will lead you to the
raiding party.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did lead them, and there were the Amalekites
scattered all over the ground, eating, drinking, and in a festive mood because
of all the rich booty they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from
the land of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From dawn to sundown David attacked them,
putting them under the ban so that none escaped except four hundred young men,
who mounted their camels and fled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David recovered everything the Amalekites had
taken, and rescued his two wives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nothing was missing, small or great, booty or
sons or daughters, of all that the Amalekites had taken. David brought back
everything. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, David took all the sheep and oxen,
and as they drove these before him, they shouted, &quot;This is David's
spoil!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David came to the two hundred men who had been
too exhausted to follow him, and whom he had left behind at the Wadi Besor,
they came out to meet David and the men with him. On nearing them David greeted
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But all the stingy and worthless men among
those who had accompanied David spoke up to say, &quot;Since they did not
accompany us, we will not give them anything from the booty, except to each man
his wife and children. Let them take those along and be on their way.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But David said: &quot;You must not do this, my
brothers, after what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and delivered
into our grip the band that came against us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Who could agree with this proposal of yours?
Rather, the share of the one who goes down to battle and that of the one who
remains with the baggage shall be the same; they shall share alike.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And from that day forward he made it a law and
a custom in Israel, as it still is today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the
spoil to the elders of Judah, city by city, saying, &quot;This is a gift to you
from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD&quot;: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to those in Bethel, to those in Ramoth-negeb,
to those in Jattir, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to those in Aroer, to those in Siphmoth, to
those in Eshtemoa, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to those in Racal, to those in the Jerahmeelite
cities, to those in the Kenite cities, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to those in Hormah, to those in Borashan, to
those in Athach, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>to those in Hebron, and to all the places
frequented by David and his men. </p>
