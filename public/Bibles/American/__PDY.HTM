<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Egypt gathered his forces, as
numerous as the sands of the seashore, and many ships; and he sought by deceit
to take Alexander's kingdom and add it to his own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He entered Syria with peaceful words, and the
people in the cities opened their gates to welcome him, as King Alexander had
ordered them to do, since Ptolemy was his father-in-law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when Ptolemy entered the cities, he
stationed garrison troops in each one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he reached Azotus, he was shown the temple
of Dagon destroyed by fire, Azotus and its suburbs demolished, corpses lying
about, and the charred bodies of those burned by Jonathan in the war and
stacked up along his route. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To prejudice the king against Jonathan, he was
told what the latter had done; but the king said nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan met the king with pomp at Joppa, and
they greeted each other and spent the night there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13P href="__PDY.HTM#$13P">1</a></sup></font></sup> Jonathan accompanied the king as far as the
river called Eleutherus and then returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13Q href="__PDY.HTM#$13Q">2</a></sup></font></sup> Plotting evil against Alexander, King Ptolemy
took possession of the cities along the seacoast as far as Seleucia-by-the-Sea.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sent ambassadors to King Demetrius, saying:
&quot;Come, let us make a pact with each other; I will give you my daughter
whom Alexander has married, and you shall reign over your father's kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13R href="__PDY.HTM#$13R">3</a></sup></font></sup> I regret that I gave him my daughter, for he
has sought to kill me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His real reason for accusing Alexander,
however, was that he coveted Alexander's kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After taking his daughter away and giving her
to Demetrius, Ptolemy broke with Alexander; their enmity became open. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and assumed the
crown of Asia; he thus wore two crowns on his head, that of Egypt and that of
Asia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Alexander was in Cilicia at that time,
because the people of that region had revolted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Alexander heard the news, he came to
challenge Ptolemy in battle. Ptolemy marched out and met him with a strong
force and put him to flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Alexander fled to Arabia to seek protection.
King Ptolemy's triumph was complete </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when the Arab Zabdiel cut off Alexander's head
and sent it to Ptolemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But three days later King Ptolemy himself died,
and his men in the fortified cities were killed by the inhabitants of the
strongholds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13S href="__PDY.HTM#$13S">4</a></sup></font></sup> Thus Demetrius became king in the year one
hundred and sixty-seven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time Jonathan gathered together the men
of Judea to attack the citadel in Jerusalem, and they set up many machines
against it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some transgressors of the law, enemies of their
own nation, went to the king and informed him that Jonathan was besieging the
citadel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Demetrius heard this, he was furious, and
set out immediately for Ptolemais. He wrote to Jonathan to discontinue the
siege and to meet him for a conference at Ptolemais as soon as possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On hearing this, Jonathan ordered the siege to
continue. He selected some elders and priests of Israel and exposed himself to
danger </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>by going to the king at Ptolemais. He brought
with him silver, gold apparel, and many other presents, and found favor with
the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Although some impious men of his own nation
brought charges against him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king treated him just as his predecessors
had done and showed him great honor in the presence of all his Friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He confirmed him in the high priesthood and in
all the honors he had previously held, and had him enrolled among his Chief
Friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan asked the king to exempt Judea and the
three districts of Samaria from tribute, promising him in return three hundred
talents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king agreed and wrote the following letter
to Jonathan about all these matters: Pact with Demetrius </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13T href="__PDY.HTM#$13T">5</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;King Demetrius sends greetings to his
brother Jonathan and to the Jewish nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13U href="__PDY.HTM#$13U">6</a></sup></font></sup> We are sending you, for your information, a
copy of the letter that we wrote to Lasthenes our kinsman concerning you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;'King Demetrius sends greetings to his
father Lasthenes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because of the good will they show us, we have
decided to bestow benefits on the Jewish nation, who are our friends and who
observe their obligations to us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13V href="__PDY.HTM#$13V">7</a></sup></font></sup> Therefore we confirm their possession, not
only of the territory of Judea, but also of the three districts of Aphairema,
Lydda, and Ramathaim. These districts, together with all their dependencies,
were transferred from Samaria to Judea in favor of all those who offer
sacrifices for us in Jerusalem instead of paying the royal taxes that formerly
the king received from them each year from the produce of the soil and the
fruit of the trees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From this day on we grant them release from
payment of all other things that would henceforth be due to us, that is, of
tithes and tribute and of the tax on the salt pans and the crown tax. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Henceforth none of these provisions shall ever
be revoked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Be sure, therefore, to have a copy of these
instructions made and given to Jonathan, that it may be displayed in a
conspicuous place on the holy hill.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When King Demetrius saw that the land was
peaceful under his rule and that he had no opposition, he dismissed his entire
army, every man to his home, except the foreign troops which he had hired from
the islands of the nations. So all the soldiers who had served under his
predecessors hated him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When a certain Trypho, who had previously
belonged to Alexander's party, saw that all the troops were grumbling at
Demetrius, he went to Imalkue the Arab, who was bringing up Alexander's young
son Antiochus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Trypho kept urging Imalkue to hand over the boy
to him, that he might make him king in his father's place. During his stay
there of many days, he told him of all that Demetrius had done and of the
hatred that his soldiers had for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile Jonathan sent the request to King
Demetrius to withdraw his troops from the citadel of Jerusalem and from the
other strongholds, for they were constantly hostile to Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Demetrius, in turn, sent this word to Jonathan:
&quot;I will not only do this for you and your nation, but I will greatly honor
you and your nation when I find the opportunity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do me the favor, therefore, of sending men to
fight for me, because all my troops have revolted.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jonathan sent three thousand good fighting
men to him at Antioch. When they came to the king, he was delighted over their
arrival, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for the populace, one hundred and twenty
thousand strong, had massed in the center of the city in an attempt to kill
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he took refuge in the palace, while the
populace gained control of the main streets and began to fight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king called the Jews to his aid. They
all rallied around him and spread out through the city. On that day they killed
about a hundred thousand men in the city, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>which, at the same time, they set on fire and
plundered on a large scale. Thus they saved the king's life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the populace saw that the Jews held the
city at their mercy, they lost courage and cried out to the king in
supplication, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Give us your terms and let the Jews stop
attacking us and our city.&quot; So they threw down their arms and made peace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Jews thus gained glory in the eyes of the
king and all his subjects, and they became renowned throughout his kingdom.
Finally they returned to Jerusalem with much spoil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when King Demetrius was sure of his royal
throne, and the land was peaceful under his rule, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he broke all his promises and became estranged
from Jonathan. Instead of rewarding Jonathan for all the favors he had received
from him, he caused him much trouble. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, Trypho returned and brought with
him the young boy Antiochus, who became king and wore the royal crown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the soldiers whom Demetrius had discharged
rallied around Antiochus and fought against Demetrius, who was routed and fled.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Trypho captured the elephants and occupied
Antioch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan: &quot;I
confirm you in the high priesthood and appoint you ruler over the four
districts and wish you to be one of the King's Friends.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also sent him gold dishes and a dinner
service, gave him the right to drink from gold cups, to dress in royal purple,
and to wear a gold buckle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>59
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13W href="__PDY.HTM#$13W">8</a></sup></font></sup> Likewise, he made Jonathan's brother Simon
governor of the region from the Ladder of Tyre to the frontier of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13X href="__PDY.HTM#$13X">9</a></sup></font></sup> Jonathan set out and traveled through
West-of-Euphrates and its cities, and all the forces of Syria espoused his
cause as allies. When he arrived at Ashkalon, the citizens welcomed him with
pomp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>61
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when he set out for Gaza, the people of
Gaza locked their gates against him. So he besieged it and burned and plundered
its suburbs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>62
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the people of Gaza appealed to him for
mercy, and he granted them peace. He took the sons of their chief men as
hostages and sent them to Jerusalem. He then traveled on through the province
as far as Damascus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>63
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius
had come with a strong force to Kadesh in Galilee, intending to remove him from
office. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>64
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he went to meet them, leaving his brother
Simon in the province. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>65
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Simon besieged Beth-zur, attacked it for many
days, and blockaded the inhabitants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>66
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they sued for peace, he granted it to
them. He expelled them from the city, took possession of it, and put a garrison
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>67
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13Y href="__PDY.HTM#$13Y">10</a></sup></font></sup> Meanwhile, Jonathan and his army pitched their
camp near the waters of Gennesaret, and at daybreak they went to the plain of
Hazor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>68
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There, in front of him on the plain, was the
army of the foreigners. This army attacked him in the open, having first
detached an ambush against him in the mountains. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>69
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the men in ambush rose out of their places
and joined in the battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>70
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All of Jonathan's men fled; no one stayed
except the army commanders Mattathias, son of Absalom, and Judas, son of
Chalphi. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>71
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan tore his clothes, threw earth on his
head, and prayed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>72
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he went back to the combat and so
overwhelmed the enemy that they took to flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>73
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those of his men who were running away saw it
and returned to him; and with him they pursued the enemy as far as their camp
in Kadesh, where they pitched their own camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>74
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Three thousand of the foreign troops fell on
that day. Then Jonathan returned to Jerusalem. </p>
