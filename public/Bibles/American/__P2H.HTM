<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Bezalel, therefore, will set to work with
Oholiab and with all the experts whom the LORD has endowed with skill and
understanding in knowing how to execute all the work for the service of the
sanctuary, just as the LORD has commanded.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses then called Bezalel and Oholiab and all
the other experts whom the LORD had endowed with skill, men whose hearts moved
them to come and take part in the work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They received from Moses all the contributions
which the Israelites had brought for establishing the service of the sanctuary.
Still, morning after morning the people continued to bring their voluntary
offerings to Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon the experts who were executing the
various kinds of work for the sanctuary, all left the work they were doing, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and told Moses, &quot;The people are bringing
much more than is needed to carry out the work which the LORD has commanded us
to do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses, therefore, ordered a proclamation to be
made throughout the camp: &quot;Let neither man nor woman make any more
contributions for the sanctuary.&quot; So the people stopped bringing their
offerings; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>there was already enough at hand, in fact, more
than enough, to complete the work to be done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The various experts who were executing the
work, made the Dwelling with its ten sheets woven of fine linen twined, having
cherubim embroidered on them with violet, purple and scarlet yarn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The length of each sheet was twenty-eight
cubits, and the width four cubits; all the sheets were of the same size. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Five of the sheets were sewed together, edge to
edge; and the same for the other five. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Loops of violet yarn were made along the edge
of the end sheet in the first set, and the same along the edge of the end sheet
in the second set. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fifty loops were thus put on one inner sheet,
and fifty loops on the inner sheet in the other set, with the loops directly
opposite each other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then fifty clasps of gold were made, with which
the sheets were joined so that the Dwelling formed one whole. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Sheets of goat hair were also woven as a tent
over the Dwelling. Eleven such sheets were made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The length of each sheet was thirty cubits and
the width four cubits; all eleven sheets were the same size. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Five of these sheets were sewed edge to edge
into one set; and the other six sheets into another set. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fifty loops were made along the edge of the end
sheet in one set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding sheet in
the other set. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fifty bronze clasps were made with which the
tent was joined so that it formed one whole. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A covering for the tent was made of rams' skins
dyed red, and above that, a covering of tahash skins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Boards of acacia wood were made as walls for
the Dwelling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The length of each board was ten cubits, and
the width one and a half cubits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each board had two arms, fastening them in
line. In this way all the boards of the Dwelling were made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were set up as follows: twenty boards on
the south side, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with forty silver pedestals under the twenty
boards, so that there were two pedestals under each board, at its two arms; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>twenty boards on the other side of the
Dwelling, the north side, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with their forty silver pedestals, two under
each board; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>six boards at the rear of the Dwelling, to the
west; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and two boards at the corners in the rear of
the Dwelling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These were double at the bottom, and likewise
double at the top, to the first ring. That is how both boards in the corners
were made. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus, there were in the rear eight boards, with
their sixteen silver pedestals, two pedestals under each board. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Bars of acacia wood were also made, five for
the boards on one side of the Dwelling, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>five for those on the other side, and five for
those at the rear, to the west. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The center bar, at the middle of the boards,
was made to reach across from end to end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The boards were plated with gold, and gold
rings were made on them as holders for the bars, which were also plated with
gold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The veil was woven of violet, purple and
scarlet yarn, and of fine linen twined, with cherubim embroidered on it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Four gold-plated columns of acacia wood, with
gold hooks, were made for it, and four silver pedestals were cast for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The curtain for the entrance of the tent was
made of violet, purple and scarlet yarn, and of fine linen twined, woven in a
variegated manner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Its five columns, with their hooks as well as
their capitals and bands, were plated with gold; their five pedestals were of
bronze. </p>
