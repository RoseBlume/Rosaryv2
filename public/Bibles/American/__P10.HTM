<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5C href="__P10.HTM#$5C">1</a></sup></font></sup> Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had borne to
Jacob, went out to visit some of the women of the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5D href="__P10.HTM#$5D">2</a></sup></font></sup> When Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, who was
chief of the region, saw her, he seized her and lay with her by force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since he was strongly attracted to Dinah,
daughter of Jacob, indeed was really in love with the girl, he endeavored to
win her affection. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shechem also asked his father Hamor, &quot;Get
me this girl for a wife.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled
his daughter Dinah; but since his sons were out in the fields with his
livestock, he held his peace until they came home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to
discuss the matter with Jacob, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>just as Jacob's sons were coming in from the
fields. When they heard the news, the men were shocked and seethed with
indignation. What Shechem had done was an outrage in Israel; such a thing could
not be tolerated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hamor appealed to them, saying: &quot;My son
Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him in marriage.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us,
and take our daughters for yourselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus you can live among us. The land is open
before you; you can settle and move about freely in it, and acquire landed
property here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Shechem, too, appealed to Dinah's father
and brothers: &quot;Do me this favor, and I will pay whatever you demand of me.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No matter how high you set the bridal price, I
will pay you whatever you ask; only give me the maiden in marriage.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob's sons replied to Shechem and his father
Hamor with guile, speaking as they did because their sister Dinah had been
defiled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We could not do such a thing,&quot; they
said, &quot;as to give our sister to an uncircumcised man; that would be a
disgrace for us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We will agree with you only on this condition,
that you become like us by having every male among you circumcised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then we will give you our daughters and take
yours in marriage; we will settle among you and become one kindred people with
you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you do not comply with our terms
regarding circumcision, we will take our daughter and go away.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their proposal seemed fair to Hamor and his son
Shechem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The young man lost no time in acting in the
matter, since he was deeply in love with Jacob's daughter. Moreover he was more
highly respected than anyone else in his clan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Hamor and his son Shechem went to their town
council and thus presented the matter to their fellow townsmen: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;These men are friendly toward us. Let
them settle in the land and move about in it freely; there is ample room in the
country for them. We can marry their daughters and give our daughters to them
in marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the men will agree to live with us and form
one kindred people with us only on this condition, that every male among us be
circumcised as they themselves are. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Would not the livestock they have acquired -
all their animals - then be ours? Let us, therefore, give in to them, so that
they may settle among us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5E href="__P10.HTM#$5E">3</a></sup></font></sup> All the able-bodied men of the town agreed
with Hamor and his son Shechem, and all the males, including every able-bodied
man in the community, were circumcised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the third day, while they were still in
pain, Dinah's full brothers Simeon and Levi, two of Jacob's sons, took their
swords, advanced against the city without any trouble, and massacred all the
males. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After they had put Hamor and his son Shechem to
the sword, they took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the other sons of Jacob followed up the
slaughter and sacked the city in reprisal for their sister Dinah's defilement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They seized their flocks, herds and asses,
whatever was in the city and in the country around. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They carried off all their wealth, their women,
and their children, and took for loot whatever was in the houses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: &quot;You have brought
trouble upon me by making me loathsome to the inhabitants of the land, the
Canaanites and the Perizzites. I have so few men that, if these people unite
against me and attack me, I and my family will be wiped out.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they retorted, &quot;Should our sister have
been treated like a harlot?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

community: literally &quot;all those who go out at the gate of the city,&quot;
apparently meaning the men who go out to war. By temporarily crippling them
through circumcision, Jacob's sons deprived the city of its defenders.</p>

of Dinah and the revenge of Jacob's sons on the men of the city of Shechem
there probably lies a dimly recollected historical event connected with an
armed conflict between the earliest Israelite tribes invading central Canaan and
the Hurrian inhabitants of the Shechem region.<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
