</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-442 href="__PYD.HTM#$442">1</a></sup></font></sup> While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled
through the interior of the country and came (down) to Ephesus where he found
some disciples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to them, &quot;Did you receive the holy
Spirit when you became believers?&quot; They answered him, &quot;We have never
even heard that there is a holy Spirit.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said, &quot;How were you baptized?&quot;
They replied, &quot;With the baptism of John.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul then said, &quot;John baptized with a
baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come
after him, that is, in Jesus.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this, they were baptized in the
name of the Lord Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when Paul laid (his) hands on them, the holy
Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Altogether there were about twelve men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He entered the synagogue, and for three months
debated boldly with persuasive arguments about the kingdom of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when some in their obstinacy and disbelief
disparaged the Way before the assembly, he withdrew and took his disciples with
him and began to hold daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This continued for two years with the result
that all the inhabitants of the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord,
Jews and Greeks alike. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So extraordinary were the mighty deeds God
accomplished at the hands of Paul </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that when face cloths or aprons that touched
his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil
spirits came out of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to
invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirits, saying, &quot;I
adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high
priest, tried to do this, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the evil spirit said to them in reply,
&quot;Jesus I recognize, Paul I know, but who are you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The person with the evil spirit then sprang at
them and subdued them all. He so overpowered them that they fled naked and
wounded from that house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this became known to all the Jews and
Greeks who lived in Ephesus, fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord
Jesus was held in great esteem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Many of those who had become believers came
forward and openly acknowledged their former practices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, a large number of those who had
practiced magic collected their books and burned them in public. They
calculated their value and found it to be fifty thousand silver pieces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus did the word of the Lord continue to spread
with influence and power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this was concluded, Paul made up his mind
to travel through Macedonia and Achaia, and then to go on to Jerusalem, saying,
&quot;After I have been there, I must visit Rome also.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he sent to Macedonia two of his
assistants, Timothy and Erastus, while he himself stayed for a while in the
province of Asia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About that time a serious disturbance broke out
concerning the Way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a silversmith named Demetrius who
made miniature silver shrines of Artemis <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-443 href="__PYD.HTM#$443">2</a></sup></font></sup> and provided no
little work for the craftsmen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He called a meeting of these and other workers
in related crafts and said, &quot;Men, you know well that our prosperity
derives from this work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As you can now see and hear, not only in
Ephesus but throughout most of the province of Asia this Paul has persuaded and
misled a great number of people by saying that gods made by hands are not gods
at all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The danger grows, not only that our business
will be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will
be of no account, and that she whom the whole province of Asia and all the
world worship will be stripped of her magnificence.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this, they were filled with
fury and began to shout, &quot;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The city was filled with confusion, and the
people rushed with one accord into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus,
the Macedonians, Paul's traveling companions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Paul wanted to go before the crowd, but the
disciples would not let him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and even some of the Asiarchs <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-444 href="__PYD.HTM#$444">3</a></sup></font></sup>
who were friends of his sent word to him advising him not to venture into the
theater. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, others
something else; the assembly was in chaos, and most of the people had no idea
why they had come together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, as the
Jews pushed him forward, and Alexander signaled with his hand that he wished to
explain something to the gathering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they
all shouted in unison, for about two hours, &quot;Great is Artemis of the
Ephesians!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally the town clerk restrained the crowd and
said, &quot;You Ephesians, what person is there who does not know that the city
of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-445 href="__PYD.HTM#$445">4</a></sup></font></sup> of the
great Artemis and of her image that fell from the sky? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since these things are undeniable, you must
calm yourselves and not do anything rash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The men you brought here are not temple
robbers, nor have they insulted our goddess. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a
complaint against anyone, courts are in session, and there are proconsuls. Let
them bring charges against one another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you have anything further to investigate,
let the matter be settled in the lawful assembly, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for, as it is, we are in danger of being
charged with rioting because of today's conduct. There is no cause for it. We
shall (not) <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-446 href="__PYD.HTM#$446">5</a></sup></font></sup> be able to give a reason for this
demonstration.&quot; With these words he dismissed the assembly. </p>

Paul discovers other people at the same religious stage as Apollos, though they
seem to have considered themselves followers of Christ, not of the Baptist. On
the relation between baptism and the reception of the Spirit, see the note on

Artemis: the temple of Artemis at Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the
ancient world. Artemis, originally the Olympian virgin hunter, moon goddess,
and goddess of wild nature, was worshiped at Ephesus as an Asian mother goddess
and goddess of fertility. She was one of the most widely worshiped female
deities in the Hellenistic world (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYC.HTM#GOSP.ACT.18.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 18:27).</p>

and role of the Asiarchs is disputed. They appear to have been people of wealth
and influence who promoted the Roman imperial cult and who may also have been
political representatives in a league of cities in the Roman province of Asia.</p>

title was accorded by Rome to cities that provided a temple for the imperial
cult. Inscriptional evidence indicates that Ephesus was acknowledged as the
temple keeper of Artemis and of the imperial cult. That fell from the sky: many
scholars think that this refers to a meteorite that was worshiped as an image
of the goddess.</p>
