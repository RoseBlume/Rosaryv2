<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T4 href="__P97.HTM#$T4">1</a></sup></font></sup> Elisha said: &quot;Hear the word of the LORD!
Thus says the LORD, 'At this time tomorrow a seah of fine flour will sell for a
shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in the market of Samaria.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the adjutant on whose arm the king leaned,
answered the man of God, &quot;Even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven,
how could this happen?&quot; &quot;You shall see it with your own eyes,&quot;
Elisha said, &quot;but you shall not eat of it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the city gate were four lepers who were
deliberating, &quot;Why should we sit here until we die? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If we decide to go into the city, we shall die
there, for there is famine in the city. If we remain here, we shall die too.
Come, let us desert to the camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we live; if
they kill us, we die.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At twilight they left for the Arameans; but
when they reached the edge of the camp, no one was there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T5 href="__P97.HTM#$T5">2</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD had caused the army of the Arameans
to hear the sound of chariots and horses, the din of a large army, and they had
reasoned among themselves, &quot;The king of Israel has hired the kings of the
Hittites and the kings of the borderlands to fight us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then in the twilight they fled, abandoning
their tents, their horses, and their asses, the whole camp just as it was, and
fleeing for their lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the lepers reached the edge of the camp,
they went first into one tent, ate and drank, and took silver, gold, and
clothing from it, and went out and hid them. Back they came into another tent,
took things from it, and again went out and hid them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they said to one another: &quot;We are not
doing right. This is a day of good news, and we are keeping silent. If we wait
until morning breaks, we shall be blamed. Come, let us go and inform the
palace.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They came and summoned the city gatekeepers.
&quot;We went to the camp of the Arameans,&quot; they said, &quot;but no one
was there - not a human voice, only the horses and asses tethered, and the
tents just as they were left.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The gatekeepers announced this and it was
reported within the palace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though it was night, the king got up; he said
to his servants: &quot;Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us.
Knowing that we are in famine, they have left their camp to hide in the field,
hoping to take us alive and enter our city when we leave it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of his servants, however, suggested:
&quot;Since those who are left in the city are no better off than all the
throng that has perished, let some of us take five of the abandoned horses and
send scouts to investigate.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took two chariots, and horses, and the
king sent them to reconnoiter the Aramean army. &quot;Go and find out,&quot; he
ordered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They followed the Arameans as far as the
Jordan, and the whole route was strewn with garments and other objects that the
Arameans had thrown away in their haste. The messengers returned and told the
king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people went out and plundered the camp of
the Arameans; and then a seah of fine flour sold for a shekel and two seahs of
barley for a shekel, as the LORD had said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king put in charge of the gate the officer
who was his adjutant; but the people trampled him to death at the gate, just as
the man of God had predicted when the king visited him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the man of
God to the king, &quot;Two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and one seah
of fine flour for a shekel at this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The adjutant had answered the man of God,
&quot;Even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, how could this
happen?&quot; And Elisha had replied, &quot;You shall see it with your own
eyes, but you shall not eat of it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And that is what happened to him, for the
people trampled him to death at the gate. </p>
