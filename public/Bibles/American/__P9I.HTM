<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the third year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king
of Israel, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was twenty-five years old when he became
king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abi,
daughter of Zechariah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He pleased the LORD, just as his forefather
David had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was he who removed the high places,
shattered the pillars, and cut down the sacred poles. He smashed the bronze
serpent called Nehushtan which Moses had made, because up to that time the
Israelites were burning incense to it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He put his trust in the LORD, the God of
Israel; and neither before him nor after him was there anyone like him among
all the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Loyal to the LORD, Hezekiah never turned away
from him, but observed the commandments which the LORD had given Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD was with him, and he prospered in all
that he set out to do. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not
serve him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also subjugated the watchtowers and walled
cities of the Philistines, all the way to Gaza and its territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TX href="__P9I.HTM#$TX">1</a></sup></font></sup> In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was
the seventh year of Hoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of
Assyria, attacked Samaria, laid siege to it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and after three years captured it. In the sixth
year of Hezekiah, the ninth year of Hoshea, king of Israel, Samaria was taken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Assyria then deported the
Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, at the Habor, a river of
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This came about because they had not heeded the
warning of the LORD, their God, but violated his covenant, not heeding and not
fulfilling the commandments of Moses, the servant of the LORD. </p>

King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, went on an expedition against all
the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent this message to
the king of Assyria at Lachish: &quot;I have done wrong. Leave me, and I will
pay whatever tribute you impose on me.&quot; The king of Assyria exacted three
hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold from Hezekiah, king of
Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah paid him all the funds there were in
the temple of the LORD and in the palace treasuries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He broke up the door panels and the uprights of
the temple of the LORD which he himself had ordered to be overlaid with gold,
and gave the gold to the king of Assyria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-U0 href="__P9I.HTM#$U0">4</a></sup></font></sup> The king of Assyria sent the general, the lord
chamberlain, and the commander from Lachish with a great army to King Hezekiah
at Jerusalem. They went up, and on their arrival in Jerusalem, stopped at the
conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the fuller's field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They called for the king, who sent out to them
Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, the master of the palace; Shebnah the scribe; and the
herald Joah, son of Asaph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The commander said to them, &quot;Tell
Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you base
this confidence of yours? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do you think mere words substitute for strategy
and might in war? On whom, then, do you rely, that you rebel against me? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This Egypt, the staff on which you rely, is in
fact a broken reed which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. That is
what Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is to all who rely on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you say to me, We rely on the LORD, our
God, is not he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed,
commanding Judah and Jerusalem to worship before this altar in Jerusalem?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now, make a wager with my lord, the king
of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses if you can put riders on them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How then can you repulse even one of the least
servants of my lord, relying as you do on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was it without the LORD'S will that I have come
up to destroy this place? The LORD said to me, 'Go up and destroy that
land!'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and
Joah said to the commander: &quot;Please speak to your servants in Aramaic; we
understand it. Do not speak to us in Judean within earshot of the people who
are on the wall.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the commander replied: &quot;Was it to your
master and to you that my lord sent me to speak these words? Was it not rather
to the men sitting on the wall, who, with you, will have to eat their own
excrement and drink their urine?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the commander stepped forward and cried
out in a loud voice in Judean, &quot;Listen to the words of the great king, the
king of Assyria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah
deceive you, since he cannot deliver you out of my hand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let not Hezekiah induce you to rely on the
LORD, saying, The LORD will surely save us; this city will not be handed over
to the king of Assyria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not listen to Hezekiah, for the king of
Assyria says: Make peace with me and surrender! Then each of you will eat of
his own vine and of his own fig-tree, and drink the water of his own cistern, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>until I come to take you to a land like your
own, a land of grain and wine, of bread and orchards, of olives, oil and fruit
syrup. Choose life, not death. Do not listen to Hezekiah when he would seduce
you by saying, The LORD will rescue us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Has any of the gods of the nations ever rescued
his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where
are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Avva? Where are the gods of the land of
Samaria? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Which of the gods for all these lands ever
rescued his land from my hand? Will the LORD then rescue Jerusalem from my
hand?'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the people remained silent and did not
answer him one word, for the king had ordered them not to answer him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the master of the palace, Eliakim, son of
Hilkiah, Shebnah the scribe, and the herald Joah, son of Asaph, came to
Hezekiah with their garments torn, and reported to him what the commander had </p>
