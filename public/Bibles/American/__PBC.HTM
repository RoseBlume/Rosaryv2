<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 28</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king,
and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not please the LORD as his
forefather David had done, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but conducted himself like the kings of Israel
and even made molten idols of the Baals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, he offered sacrifice in the Valley of
Ben-hinnom,
and immolated his sons by fire according to the abominable practice of the
nations which the LORD had cleared out before the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He offered sacrifice and incense on the high
places, on hills, and under every leafy tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the LORD, his God, delivered him into
the power of the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and carried away
captive a large number of his people, whom they brought to Damascus. He was
also delivered into the power of the king of Israel, who defeated him with
great slaughter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For Pekah, son of Remaliah, slew one hundred
and twenty thousand of Judah in a single day, all of them valiant men, because
they had abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zichri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah,
the king's son, and Azrikam, the master of the palace, and also Elkanah, who
was second to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites took away as captives two
hundred thousand of their brethren's wives, sons and daughters; they also took
from them much plunder, which they brought to Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Samaria there was a prophet of the LORD by
the name of Oded. He went out to meet the army returning to Samaria and said to
them: &quot;It was because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with
Judah that he delivered them into your hands. You, however, have slaughtered
them with a fury that has reached up to heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now you are planning to make the children
of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves and bondwomen. Are not you yourselves,
therefore, guilty of a crime against the LORD, your God? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now listen to me: send back the captives you
have carried off from among your brethren, for the burning anger of the LORD is
upon you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this, some of the Ephraimite leaders,
Azariah, son of Johanan, Berechiah, son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, son of
Shallum, and Amasa, son of Hadlai, themselves stood up in opposition to those
who had returned from the war. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to them: &quot;Do not bring the
captives here, for what you propose will make us guilty before the LORD and
increase our sins and our guilt. Our guilt is already great, and there is a
burning anger upon Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the soldiers left their captives and
the plunder before the princes and the whole assembly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the men just named proceeded to help the
captives. All of them who were naked they clothed from the booty; they clothed
them, put sandals on their feet, gave them food and drink, anointed them, and
all who were weak they set on asses. They brought them to Jericho, the city of
palms, to their brethren. Then they returned to Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time King Ahaz sent an appeal for help
to the kings of Assyria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Edomites had returned, attacked Judah, and carried
off captives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines too had raided the cities of
the foothills and the Negeb of Judah; they captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon,
Gederoth, Soco and its dependencies, Timnah and its dependencies, and Gimzo and
its dependencies, and occupied them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WZ href="__PBC.HTM#$WZ">1</a></sup></font></sup> For the LORD had brought Judah low because of
Ahaz, king of Israel, who let Judah go its own way and proved utterly faithless
to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, did indeed
come to him, but to oppress him rather than to help him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Though Ahaz plundered the LORD'S house and the
houses of the king and the princes to make payment to the king of Assyria, it
availed him nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While he was already in distress, the same King
Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus who had
defeated him, saying, &quot;Since it was the gods of the kings of Aram who
helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me also.&quot;
However, they only caused further disaster to him and to all Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahaz gathered up the utensils of God's house
and broke them in pieces. He closed the doors of the LORD'S house and had altars
made for himself in every corner of Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In every city throughout Judah he set up high
places to offer sacrifice to other gods. Thus he angered the LORD, the God of
his fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of his deeds and his activities, first
and last, can be found written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried
in Jerusalem - in the city, for they did not bring him to the tombs of the
kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah succeeded him as king. </p>
