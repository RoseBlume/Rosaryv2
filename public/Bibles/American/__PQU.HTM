<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GB href="__PQU.HTM#$2GB">1</a></sup></font></sup> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he
became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did what was evil in the eyes of the LORD,
just as Jehoiakim had done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Indeed, what was done in Jerusalem and in Judah
so angered the LORD that he cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled
against the king of Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2GC href="__PQU.HTM#$2GC">2</a></sup></font></sup> In the tenth month of the ninth year of his
reign, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and his
whole army advanced against Jerusalem, encamped around it, and built siege
walls on every side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The siege of the city continued until the
eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the ninth day of the fourth month, when
famine had gripped the city and the people had no more bread, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the city walls were breached. Then all the
soldiers took to flight and left the city by night through the gate between the
two walls which was near the king's garden. With the Chaldeans surrounding the
city, they went in the direction of the Arabah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Chaldean army pursued the king and
overtook Zedekiah in the desert near Jericho, while his whole army fled from
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king, therefore, was arrested and brought
to Riblah, in the land of Hamath, to the king of Babylon, who pronounced
sentence on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Zedekiah looked on, the king of Babylon slew
his sons as well as all the princes of Judah at Riblah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he blinded Zedekiah, bound him with
fetters, and had him brought to Babylon and kept in prison until the day of his
death. </p>

captain of the bodyguard, came to Jerusalem as the representative of the king
of Babylon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He burned the house of the LORD, the palace of
the king, and all the houses of Jerusalem; every large building he destroyed
with fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the Chaldean troops who were with the
captain of the guard tore down all the walls that surrounded Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, led
into exile the rest of the people left in the city, and those who had deserted
to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But some of the country's poor, Nebuzaradan, captain
of the guard, left behind as vinedressers and farmers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The bronze pillars that belonged to the house
of the LORD, and the wheeled carts and the bronze sea in the house of the LORD,
the Chaldeans broke into pieces; they carried away all the bronze to Babylon. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took also the pots, the shovels, the
snuffers, the bowls, the pans, and all the bronze vessels used for service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The basins also, the fire holders, the bowls,
the pots, the lampstands, the pans, the sacrificial bowls which were of gold or
silver, these too the captain of the guard carried off, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as well as the two pillars, the one sea, and
the twelve oxen of bronze under the sea, and the wheeled carts which King
Solomon had made for the house of the LORD. The bronze of all these furnishings
could not be weighed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each of the pillars was eighteen cubits high

<p class=MsoNormal>22

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A bronze capital five cubits high surmounted
the one pillar, and a network with pomegranates encircled the capital, all of
brass; and so for the other pillar. The pomegranates. . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>there were ninety-six pomegranates. There were
a hundred pomegranates, all around the network. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The captain of the guard also took Seraiah, the
high priest, Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And from the city he took one courtier, a
commander of soldiers, and seven men in the personal service of the king who
were present in the city, and the scribe of the army commander who mustered the
people of the land, and sixty of the common people who were in the city. </p>

these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, </p>
