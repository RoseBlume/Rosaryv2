<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:center'><b><i>First edition of the New Testament</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The New Testament translation has been
approached with essentially the same fidelity to the thought and individual
style of the biblical writers as was applied in the Old Testament. In some cases,
however, the problem of marked literary peculiarities had to be met. What by
any Western standard are the limited vocabularies and stylistic infelicities of
the evangelists cannot be retained in the exact form in which they appear in
the originals without displeasing the modern ear. A compromise is here
attempted whereby some measure of the poverty of the evangelists' expression is
kept and placed at the service of their message in its richness. Similarly, the
syntactical shortcomings of Paul, his frequent lapses into anacoluthon, and the
like, are rendered as they occur in his epistles rather than &quot;smoothed
out.&quot; Only thus, the translators suppose, will contemporary readers have
some adequate idea of the kind of writing they have before them. When the prose
of the original flows more smoothly, as in Luke, Acts, and Hebrews, it is
reflected in the translation. </p>

<p>The Gospel according to
John comprises a special case. Absolute fidelity to his technique of reiterated
phrasing would result in an assault on the English ear, yet the softening of
the vocal effect by substitution of other words and phrases would destroy the
effectiveness of his poetry. Again, resort is had to compromise. This is not an
easy matter when the very repetitiousness which the author deliberately
employed is at the same time regarded by those who read and speak English to be
a serious stylistic defect. Only those familiar with the Greek originals can
know what a relentless tattoo Johannine poetry can produce. A similar
observation could be made regarding other New Testament books as well. Matthew
and Mark are given to identical phrasing twice and three times in the same
sentence. As for the rhetorical overgrowth and mixed figures of speech in the
letters of Peter, James, and Jude, the translator must resist a powerful
compulsion to tidy them up if only to render these letters intelligibly.</p>

<p>Without seeking refuge in
complaints against the inspired authors, however, the translators of <em>The
New American Bible</em> here state that what they have attempted is a
translation rather than a paraphrase. To be sure, all translation can be called
paraphrase by definition. Any striving for complete fidelity will shortly end
in infidelity. Nonetheless, it must be pointed out that the temptation to
improve overladen sentences by the consolidation or elimination of multiplied
adjectives, or the simplification of clumsy hendiadys, has been resisted here.
For the most part, rhetorically ineffective words and phrases are retained in
this translation in some form, even when it is clear that a Western
contemporary writer would never have employed them.</p>

<p>The spelling of proper
names in <em>The New American Bible</em> follows the customary forms found in
most English Bibles since the Authorized Version.</p>

<p>Despite the arbitrary character
of the divisions into numbered verses (a scheme which in its present form is
only four centuries old), the translators have made a constant effort to keep
within an English verse the whole verbal content of the Greek verse. At times
the effort has not seemed worth the result since it often does violence to the
original author's flow of expression, which preceded it by so many centuries.
If this translation had been prepared for purposes of public reading only, the
editors would have forgone the effort at an early stage. But since they never
departed from the threefold objective of preparing a translation suitable for
liturgical use, private reading, and the purposes of students, the last-named
consideration prevailed. Those familiar with Greek should be able to discover
how the translators of the New Testament have rendered any given original verse
of scripture, if their exegetical or theological tasks require them to know
this. At the same time, the fact should be set down here that the editors did not
commit themselves in the synoptic gospels to rendering repeated words or
phrases identically.</p>

<p>This leads to a final
consideration: the Greek text used for the New Testament. Here, punctuation and
verse division are at least as important as variant readings. In general,
Nestle-Aland's <em>Novum Testamentum Graece</em> (25th edition, 1963) was
followed. Additional help was derived from <em>The Greek New Testament</em>
(Aland, Black, Metzger, Wikgren), produced for the use of translators by the
United Bible Societies in 1966. However, the editors did not confine themselves
strictly to these texts; at times, they inclined toward readings otherwise
attested. The omission of alternative translations does not mean that the
translators think them without merit, but only that in every case they had to
make a choice.</p>

<p style='margin-right:1.3pt'>Poorly
attested readings do not occur in this translation. Doubtful readings of some
merit appear within brackets; public readers may include such words or phrases,
or omit them entirely without any damage to sense. Parentheses are used, as
ordinarily in English, as a punctuation device. Material they enclose is in no
sense textually doubtful. It is simply thought to be parenthetical in the
intention of the biblical author, even though there is no such punctuation mark
in Greek. The difficulty in dealing with quotation marks is well known. Since
they do not appear in any form in the original text, wherever they occur here
they constitute an editorial decision.</p>
