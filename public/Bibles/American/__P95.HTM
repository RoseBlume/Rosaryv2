<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 5</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Naaman, the army commander of the king of Aram,
was highly esteemed and respected by his master, for through him the LORD had
brought victory to Aram. But valiant as he was, the man was a leper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the Arameans had captured from the land of
Israel in a raid a little girl, who became the servant of Naaman's wife. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If only my master would present himself
to the prophet in Samaria,&quot; she said to her mistress, &quot;he would cure
him of his leprosy.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Naaman went and told his lord just what the
slave girl from the land of Israel had said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go,&quot; said the king of Aram. &quot;I
will send along a letter to the king of Israel.&quot; So Naaman set out, taking
along ten silver talents, six thousand gold pieces, and ten festal garments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To the king of Israel he brought the letter,
which read: &quot;With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you, that
you may cure him of his leprosy.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he read the letter, the king of Israel
tore his garments and exclaimed: &quot;Am I a god with power over life and
death, that this man should send someone to me to be cured of leprosy? Take
note! You can see he is only looking for a quarrel with me!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the
king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent word to the king: &quot;Why have
you torn your garments? Let him come to me and find out that there is a prophet
in Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Naaman came with his horses and chariots and
stopped at the door of Elisha's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet sent him the message: &quot;Go and
wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will heal, and you will be
clean.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Naaman went away angry, saying, &quot;I
thought that he would surely come out and stand there to invoke the LORD his
God, and would move his hand over the spot, and thus cure the leprosy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T0 href="__P95.HTM#$T0">1</a></sup></font></sup> Are not the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and
the Pharpar, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and
be cleansed?&quot; With this, he turned about in anger and left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his servants came up and reasoned with him.
&quot;My father,&quot; they said, &quot;if the prophet had told you to do
something extraordinary, would you not have done it? All the more now, since he
said to you, 'Wash and be clean,' should you do as he said.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan
seven times at the word of the man of God. His flesh became again like the
flesh of a little child, and he was clean. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He returned with his whole retinue to the man
of God. On his arrival he stood before him and said, &quot;Now I know that
there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel. Please accept a gift from
your servant.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;As the LORD lives whom I serve, I will
not take it,&quot; Elisha replied; and despite Naaman's urging, he still
refused. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T1 href="__P95.HTM#$T1">2</a></sup></font></sup> Naaman said: &quot;If you will not accept,
please let me, your servant, have two mule-loads of earth, for I will no longer
offer holocaust or sacrifice to any other god except to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I trust the LORD will forgive your servant
this: when my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, then I, too,
as his adjutant, must bow down in the temple of Rimmon. May the LORD forgive
your servant this.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T2 href="__P95.HTM#$T2">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;Go in peace,&quot; Elisha said to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Naaman had gone some distance when Gehazi, the
servant of Elisha, the man of God, thought to himself: &quot;My master was too
easy with this Aramean Naaman, not accepting what he brought. As the LORD
lives, I will run after him and get something out of him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. Aware that
someone was running after him, Naaman alighted from his chariot to wait for
him. &quot;Is everything all right?&quot; he asked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Yes,&quot; Gehazi replied, &quot;but my
master sent me to say, 'Two young men have just come to me, guild prophets from
the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two festal
garments.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Please take two talents,&quot; Naaman
said, and pressed them upon him. He tied up these silver talents in bags and
gave them, with the two festal garments, to two of his servants, who carried
them before Gehazi. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they reached the hill, Gehazi took what
they had, carried it into the house, and sent the men on their way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He went in and stood before Elisha his master,
who asked him, &quot;Where have you been, Gehazi?&quot; He answered, &quot;Your
servant has not gone anywhere.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Elisha said to him: &quot;Was I not present
in spirit when the man alighted from his chariot to wait for you? Is this a
time to take money or to take garments, olive orchards or vineyards, sheep or
cattle, male or female servants? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your
descendants forever.&quot; And Gehazi left Elisha, a leper white as snow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
