<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some time afterward, Joseph was informed,
&quot;Your father is failing.&quot; So he took along with him his two sons,
Manasseh and Ephraim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jacob was told, &quot;Your son Joseph has
come to you,&quot; he rallied his strength and sat up in bed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6M href="__P1E.HTM#$6M">1</a></sup></font></sup> Jacob then said to Joseph: &quot;God Almighty
appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessing me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, 'I will make you fertile and numerous
and raise you into an assembly of tribes, and I will give this land to your
descendants after you as a permanent possession.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your two sons, therefore, who were born to you
in the land of Egypt before I joined you here, shall be mine; Ephraim and
Manasseh shall be mine as much as Reuben and Simeon are mine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Progeny born to you after them shall remain
yours; but their heritage shall be recorded in the names of their two brothers.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6N href="__P1E.HTM#$6N">2</a></sup></font></sup> I do this because, when I was returning from
Paddan, your mother Rachel died, to my sorrow, during the journey in Canaan,
while we were still a short distance from Ephrath; and I buried her there on
the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he asked,
&quot;Who are these?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;They are my sons,&quot; Joseph answered
his father, &quot;whom God has given me here.&quot; &quot;Bring them to
me,&quot; said his father, &quot;that I may bless them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Now Israel's eyes were dim from age, and he
could not see well.) When Joseph brought his sons close to him, he kissed and
embraced them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Israel said to Joseph, &quot;I never
expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your
descendants as well!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph removed them from his father's knees and
bowed down before him with his face to the ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joseph took the two, Ephraim with his
right hand, to Israel's left, and Manasseh with his left hand, to Israel's
right, and led them to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Israel, crossing his hands, put out his
right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, although he was the younger, and
his left hand on the head of Manasseh, although he was the first-born. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he blessed them with these words:
&quot;May the God in whose ways my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God
who has been my shepherd from my birth to this day, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Angel who has delivered me from all harm,
bless these boys That in them my name be recalled, and the names of my fathers,
Abraham and Isaac, And they may become teeming multitudes upon the earth!&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joseph saw that his father had laid his
right hand on Ephraim's head, this seemed wrong to him; so he took hold of his
father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying, &quot;That is not right, father; the
other one is the first-born; lay your right hand on his head!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his father resisted. &quot;I know it,
son,&quot; he said, &quot;I know. That one too shall become a tribe, and he too
shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall surpass him, and his
descendants shall become a multitude of nations.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when he blessed them that day and said,
&quot;By you shall the people of Israel pronounce blessings; may they say, 'God
make you like Ephraim and Manasseh,'&quot; he placed Ephraim before Manasseh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Israel said to Joseph: &quot;I am about to
die. But God will be with you and will restore you to the land of your fathers.
</p>

brothers, which I captured. . .&quot; The reference may be to the capture of
Shechem by the sons of Jacob (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P10.HTM#PENT.GEN.34.24"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis 34:24-29).
