<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 15</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3N5 href="__PWY.HTM#$3N5">1</a></sup></font></sup> The tax collectors and sinners were all
drawing near to listen to him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but the Pharisees and scribes began to
complain, saying, &quot;This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So to them he addressed this parable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;What man among you having a hundred sheep
and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go
after the lost one until he finds it? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when he does find it, he sets it on his
shoulders with great joy </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and, upon his arrival home, he calls together
his friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have
found my lost sheep.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I tell you, in just the same way there will be
more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous
people who have no need of repentance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Or what woman having ten coins <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3N6 href="__PWY.HTM#$3N6">2</a></sup></font></sup>
and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house, searching carefully
until she finds it? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when she does find it, she calls together
her friends and neighbors and says to them, 'Rejoice with me because I have
found the coin that I lost.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In just the same way, I tell you, there will be
rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said, &quot;A man had two sons, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the younger son said to his father,
'Father, give me the share of your estate that should come to me.' So the
father divided the property between them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After a few days, the younger son collected all
his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his
inheritance on a life of dissipation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had freely spent everything, a severe
famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he hired himself out to one of the local
citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on
which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Coming to his senses he thought, 'How many of
my father's hired workers have more than enough food to eat, but here am I,
dying from hunger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I shall get up and go to my father and I shall
say to him, &quot;Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I no longer deserve to be called your son;
treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.&quot;' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he got up and went back to his father. While
he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled
with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned
against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But his father ordered his servants, 'Quickly
bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals
on his feet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then
let us celebrate with a feast, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because this son of mine was dead, and has come
to life again; he was lost, and has been found.' Then the celebration began. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the older son had been out in the field
and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard the sound of music and
dancing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He called one of the servants and asked what
this might mean. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The servant said to him, 'Your brother has
returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him
back safe and sound.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He became angry, and when he refused to enter
the house, his father came out and pleaded with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to his father in reply, 'Look, all
these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never
gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when your son returns who swallowed up your
property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to him, 'My son, you are here with me
always; everything I have is yours. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now we must celebrate and rejoice, because
your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been
found.'&quot; </p>
