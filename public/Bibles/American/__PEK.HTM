<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=MsoNormal>The Books
of Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, Wisdom, and Sirach,
are all versified by the skillful use of parallelism, that is, of the balanced
and symmetrical phrases peculiar to Hebrew poetry. With the exception of the
Psalms, the majority of which are devotional lyrics, and the Song of Songs, a
nuptial hymn, these books belong to the general class of wisdom or didactic
literature, strictly so called because their chief purpose is instruction. </p>

<p>The wisdom literature of
the Bible is the fruit of a movement among ancient oriental people to gather,
preserve and express, usually in aphoristic style, the results of human
experience as an aid toward understanding and solving the problems of life. In
Israel especially, the movement concerned itself with such basic and vital
problems as man's origin and destiny, his quest for happiness, the problem of
suffering, of good and evil in human conduct, of death, and the state beyond
the grave. Originating with oral tradition, these formulations found their way
into the historical books of the Old Testament in the shape of proverbs, odes,
chants, epigrams, and also into those psalms intended for instruction.</p>

<p>The developed compositions
of this literature form the sapiential books. The Book of Proverbs is a
collection of sentences or practical norms for moral conduct. The Book of Job
is an artistic dialogue skillfully handling the problem of suffering though
only from the standpoint of temporal life. Ecclesiastes examines a wide range
of human experience only to conclude that all things are vanity except the fear
of the Lord and observance of his commandments, and that God requites man in
his own good time. Sirach gathers and presents the fruits of past experience,
thus preparing for the Book of Wisdom, which sees for the just man seeking
happiness the full hope of immortality (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PLK.HTM#WISDB.WISD.3.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Wisdom
3:4).</p>

<p>Those who cultivated wisdom
were called sages. Men of letters, scribes, skilled in the affairs of
government, and counselors to rulers, they were instructors of the people,
especially of youth (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNH.HTM#WISDB.SIR.51.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach 51:13-30). In times
of crisis they guided the people by revaluating tradition, thus helping to
preserve unity, peace and good will. The most illustrious of the sages, and the
originator of wisdom literature in Israel, was Solomon. Because of his fame,
some of the wisdom books of which he was not the author bear his name.</p>

<p>Despite numerous
resemblances, sometimes exaggerated, between the sapiential literature of pagan
nations and the wisdom books of the Bible, the former are often replete with
vagaries and abound in polytheistic conceptions; the latter remained profoundly
human, universal, fundamentally moral, and essentially religious and
monotheistic. Under the influence of the Law and the Prophets, wisdom became
piety and virtue; impiety and vice were folly. The teachers of wisdom were
regarded as men of God, and their books were placed beside the Law and the
Prophets. The highest wisdom became identified with the spirit of God through
which the world was created and preserved (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PK7.HTM#WISDB.PRO.8.22"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Proverb
8:22-31), and mankind was enlightened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The limitations
of Old Testament wisdom served to crystalize the problems of human life and
destiny, thus preparing for their solution through New Testament revelation.
Ecclesiastes' vain search for success and happiness on earth ends when the
Savior assures these things to his followers, not in this world but in the
bliss of heaven. The anxiety in the Book of Job over reconciling God's justice
and wisdom with the suffering of the innocent is relieved by the account of the
Crucified and Risen Redeemer in the Gospel. By fulfilling all that the Psalms
foretold concerning him, Jesus makes the Psalter his prayer book and that of
the Church for all time. The love of God for the chosen people which underlies
the Song of Songs is perfected in the union of Christ with his Church. The
personification of the wisdom of Proverbs, Wisdom and Sirach shines forth in
resplendent reality in the Word who was with God, and who was God, and who
became incarnate to dwell among us; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX9.HTM#GOSP.JOH.1.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 1:2,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX9.HTM#GOSP.JOH.1.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 14. </p>
