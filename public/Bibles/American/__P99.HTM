<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 9</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The prophet Elisha called one of the guild
prophets and said to him: &quot;Gird your loins, take this flask of oil with
you, and go to Ramoth-gilead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you get there, look for Jehu, son of
Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. Enter and take him away from his companions into an
inner chamber. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the flask you have, pour oil on his head,
and say, 'Thus says the LORD: I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the
door and flee without delay.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The young man (the guild prophet) went to
Ramoth-gilead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he arrived, the commanders of the army
were in session. &quot;I have a message for you, commander,&quot; he said.
&quot;For which one of us?&quot; asked Jehu. &quot;For you, commander,&quot; he
answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the
young man poured the oil on his head and said, &quot;Thus says the LORD, the
God of Israel: 'I anoint you king over the people of the LORD, over Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TA href="__P99.HTM#$TA">1</a></sup></font></sup> You shall destroy the house of Ahab your
master; thus will I avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood
of all the other servants of the LORD shed by Jezebel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and by all the rest of the family of Ahab. I
will cut off every male in Ahab's line, whether slave or freeman in Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will deal with the house of Ahab as I dealt
with the house of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and with the house of Baasha, son of
Ahijah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Dogs shall devour Jezebel at the confines of
Jezreel, so that no one can bury her.'&quot; Then he opened the door and fled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jehu rejoined his master's servants, they
asked him, &quot;Is all well? Why did that madman come to you?&quot; You know
that kind of man and his talk, he replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they said, &quot;Not at all! Come, tell
us.&quot; So he told them what the young man had said to him, and finally,
&quot;Thus says the LORD: 'I anoint you king over Israel.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At once each took his garment, spread it under
Jehu on the bare steps, blew the trumpet, and cried out, &quot;Jehu is
king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi,
formed a conspiracy against Joram. Joram, with all Israel, had been besieging
Ramoth-gilead against Hazael, king of Aram, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but had returned to Jezreel to be healed of the
wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle against Hazael, king of
Aram. &quot;If you are truly with me,&quot; Jehu said, &quot;see that no one
escapes from the city to report in Jezreel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehu mounted his chariot and drove to
Jezreel, where Joram lay ill and Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come to visit him.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel
saw the troop of Jehu coming and reported, &quot;I see chariots.&quot;
&quot;Get a driver,&quot; Joram said, &quot;and send him to meet them and to
ask whether all is well.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So a driver went out to meet him and said,
&quot;The king asks whether all is well.&quot; &quot;What does it matter to you
how things are?&quot; Jehu said. &quot;Get behind me.&quot; The watchman
reported to the king, &quot;The messenger has reached them, but is not
returning.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joram sent a second driver, who went to them
and said, &quot;The king asks whether all is well.&quot; &quot;What does it
matter to you how things are?&quot; Jehu replied. &quot;Get behind me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The watchman reported, &quot;The messenger has
reached them, but is not returning. The driving is like that of Jehu, son of
Nimshi, in its fury.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Prepare my chariot,&quot; said Joram.
When they had done so, Joram, king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, set
out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They reached him near the field of
Naboth the Jezreelite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TB href="__P99.HTM#$TB">2</a></sup></font></sup> When Joram recognized Jehu, he asked, &quot;Is
all well, Jehu?&quot; &quot;How can all be well,&quot; Jehu replied, &quot;as
long as the many fornications and witchcrafts of your mother Jezebel
continue?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joram reined about and fled, crying to Ahaziah,
&quot;Treason, Ahaziah!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between
the shoulders, so that the arrow went through his heart and he collapsed in his
chariot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jehu said to his adjutant Bidkar,
&quot;Take him and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For I
remember that when we were driving teams behind his father Ahab, the LORD
delivered this oracle against him: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of
Naboth and the blood of his sons,' says the LORD, 'I will repay you for it in
that very plot of ground, says the LORD.' So now take him into this plot of
ground, in keeping with the word of the LORD.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seeing what was happening, Ahaziah, king of
Judah, fled toward Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, shouting, &quot;Kill him
too!&quot; And they pierced him as he rode through the pass of Gur near Ibleam.
He continued his flight as far as Megiddo and died there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His servants brought him in a chariot to
Jerusalem and buried him in the tomb of his ancestors in the City of David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh
year of Joram, son of Ahab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jezebel learned that Jehu had arrived in
Jezreel, she shadowed her eyes, adorned her hair, and looked down from her
window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Jehu came through the gate, she cried out,
&quot;Is all well, Zimri, murderer of your master?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehu looked up to the window and shouted,
&quot;Who is on my side? Anyone?&quot; At this, two or three eunuchs looked
down toward him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Throw her down,&quot; he ordered. They
threw her down, and some of her blood spurted against the wall and against the
horses. Jehu rode in over her body </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and, after eating and drinking, he said:
&quot;Attend to that accursed woman and bury her; after all, she was a king's
daughter.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they went to bury her, they found
nothing of her but the skull, the feet, and the hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They returned to Jehu, and when they told him,
he said, &quot;This is the sentence which the LORD pronounced through his servant
Elijah the Tishbite: 'In the confines of Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of
Jezebel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung in the
field in the confines of Jezreel, so that no one can say: This was
Jezebel.'&quot; </p>
