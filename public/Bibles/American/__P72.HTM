<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P6 href="__P72.HTM#$P6">1</a></sup></font></sup> In his old age Samuel appointed his sons
judges over Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His first-born was named Joel, his second son,
Abijah; they judged at Beer-sheba. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His sons did not follow his example but sought
illicit gain and accepted bribes, perverting justice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore all the elders of Israel came in a
body to Samuel at Ramah </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to him, &quot;Now that you are old,
and your sons do not follow your example, appoint a king over us, as other
nations have, to judge us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel was displeased when they asked for a
king to judge them. He prayed to the LORD, however, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who said in answer: &quot;Grant the people's
every request. It is not you they reject, they are rejecting me as their king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As they have treated me constantly from the day
I brought them up from Egypt to this day, deserting me and worshiping strange
gods, so do they treat you too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now grant their request; but at the same time,
warn them solemnly and inform them of the rights of the king who will rule
them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel delivered the message of the LORD in
full to those who were asking him for a king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He told them: &quot;The rights of the king who
will rule you will be as follows: He will take your sons and assign them to his
chariots and horses, and they will run before his chariot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will also appoint from among them his
commanders of groups of a thousand and of a hundred soldiers. He will set them
to do his plowing and his harvesting, and to make his implements of war and the
equipment of his chariots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will use your daughters as ointment-makers,
as cooks, and as bakers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will take the best of your fields,
vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will tithe your crops and your vineyards,
and give the revenue to his eunuchs and his slaves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will take your male and female servants, as
well as your best oxen and your asses, and use them to do his work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He will tithe your flocks and you yourselves
will become his slaves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When this takes place, you will complain
against the king whom you have chosen, but on that day the LORD will not answer
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people, however, refused to listen to
Samuel's warning and said, &quot;Not so! There must be a king over us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We too must be like other nations, with a king
to rule us and to lead us in warfare and fight our battles.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Samuel had listened to all the people had
to say, he repeated it to the LORD, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who then said to him, &quot;Grant their request
and appoint a king to rule them.&quot; Samuel thereupon said to the men of
Israel, &quot;Each of you go to his own city.&quot; </p>

Book of Samuel gives us two and sometimes three viewpoints on most of the
events with which it is concerned, such as the appointment of Saul as king, the
reasons for his downfall, his relationship with David, even the circumstances
of Saul's death (1 Sam 31; 2 Sam 1). The choice of Saul as king is seen, in 1
Sam 8, followed by <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P74.HTM#HIS.1SAM.10.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Sam 10:17-27 and 1 Sam 12
as motivated by the people's defection from the proper service of God; this later
editorial approach incorporates not only narratives with which it is
consistent, but also early traditions (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P73.HTM#HIS.1SAM.9.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Sam
9:1-10, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P73.HTM#HIS.1SAM.9.16"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16 and 1 Sam 11) which portray
the events and their motivation quite differently. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
