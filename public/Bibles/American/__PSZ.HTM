<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2NQ href="__PSZ.HTM#$2NQ">1</a></sup></font></sup> After King Astyages was laid with his fathers,
Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2NR href="__PSZ.HTM#$2NR">2</a></sup></font></sup> Daniel was the king's favorite and was held in
higher esteem than any of the friends of the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2NS href="__PSZ.HTM#$2NS">3</a></sup></font></sup> The Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and
every day they provided for it six barrels of fine flour, forty sheep, and six
measures of wine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king worshiped it and went every day to
adore it; but Daniel adored only his God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the king asked him, &quot;Why do you not
adore Bel?&quot; Daniel replied, &quot;Because I worship not idols made with
hands, but only the living God who made heaven and earth and has dominion over
all mankind.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king continued, &quot;You do not think
Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every
day?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel began to laugh. &quot;Do not be
deceived, O king,&quot; he said; &quot;it is only clay inside and bronze
outside; it has never taken any food or drink.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Enraged, the king called his priests and said
to them, &quot;Unless you tell me who it is that consumes these provisions, you
shall die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you can show that Bel consumes them,
Daniel shall die for blaspheming Bel.&quot; Daniel said to the king, &quot;Let
it be as you say!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were seventy priests of Bel, besides
their wives and children. When the king went with Daniel into the temple of
Bel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the priests of Bel said, &quot;See, we are
going to leave. Do you, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine; then shut
the door and seal it with your ring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you do not find that Bel has eaten it all
when you return in the morning, we are to die; otherwise Daniel shall die for
his lies against us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They were not perturbed, because under the
table they had made a secret entrance through which they always came in to
consume the food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After they departed the king set the food
before Bel, while Daniel ordered his servants to bring some ashes, which they
scattered through the whole temple; the king alone was present. Then they went
outside, sealed the closed door with the king's ring, and departed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The priests entered that night as usual, with
their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Early the next morning, the king came with
Daniel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?&quot; he
asked. And Daniel answered, &quot;They are unbroken, O king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as he had opened the door, the king
looked at the table and cried aloud, &quot;Great you are, O Bel; there is no
trickery in you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Daniel laughed and kept the king from
entering. &quot;Look at the floor,&quot; he said; &quot;whose footprints are
these?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I see the footprints of men, women, and
children!&quot; said the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The angry king arrested the priests, their
wives, and their children. They showed him the secret door by which they used
to enter to consume what was on the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He put them to death, and handed Bel over to
Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a great dragon which the Babylonians
worshiped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Look!&quot; said the king to Daniel,
&quot;you cannot deny that this is a living god, so adore it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Daniel answered, &quot;I adore the Lord, my
God, for he is the living God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give me permission, O king, and I will kill
this dragon without sword or club.&quot; &quot;I give you permission,&quot; the
king said. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Daniel took some pitch, fat, and hair;
these he boiled together and made into cakes. He put them into the mouth of the
dragon, and when the dragon ate them, he burst asunder. &quot;This,&quot; he
said, &quot;is what you worshiped.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Babylonians heard this, they were
angry and turned against the king. &quot;The king has become a Jew,&quot; they
said; &quot;he has destroyed Bel, killed the dragon, and put the priests to
death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They went to the king and demanded: &quot;Hand
Daniel over to us, or we will kill you and your family.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he saw himself threatened with violence,
the king was forced to hand Daniel over to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They threw Daniel into a lions' den, where he
remained six days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the den were seven lions, and two carcasses
and two sheep had been given to them daily. But now they were given nothing, so
that they would devour Daniel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Judea there was a prophet, Habakkuk; he
mixed some bread in a bowl with the stew he had boiled, and was going to bring
it to the reapers in the field, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>when an angel of the Lord told him, &quot;Take
the lunch you have to Daniel in the lions' den at Babylon.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Habakkuk answered, &quot;Babylon, sir, I
have never seen, and I do not know the den!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The angel of the Lord seized him by the crown
of his head and carried him by the hair; with the speed of the wind, he set him
down in Babylon above the den. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Daniel, Daniel,&quot; cried Habakkuk,
&quot;take the lunch God has sent you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have remembered me, O God,&quot; said
Daniel; &quot;you have not forsaken those who love you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While Daniel began to eat, the angel of the
Lord at once brought Habakkuk back to his own place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the seventh day the king came to mourn for
Daniel. As he came to the den and looked in, there was Daniel, sitting there! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king cried aloud, &quot;You are great, O
Lord, the God of Daniel, and there is no other besides you!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel he took out, but those who had tried to
destroy him he threw into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before
his eyes. </p>
