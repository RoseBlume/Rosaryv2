<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua gathered together all the tribes of
Israel at Shechem, summoning their elders, their leaders, their judges and
their officers. When they stood in ranks before God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M8 href="__P62.HTM#$M8">1</a></sup></font></sup> Joshua addressed all the people: &quot;Thus
says the LORD, the God of Israel: In times past your fathers, down to Terah,
father of Abraham and Nahor, dwelt beyond the River and served other gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I brought your father Abraham from the
region beyond the River and led him through the entire land of Canaan. I made
his descendants numerous, and gave him Isaac. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I
assigned the mountain region of Seir in which to settle, while Jacob and his
children went down to Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and smote
Egypt with the prodigies which I wrought in her midst. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Afterward I led you out of Egypt, and when you
reached the sea, the Egyptians pursued your fathers to the Red Sea with
chariots and horsemen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because they cried out to the LORD, he put
darkness between your people and the Egyptians, upon whom he brought the sea so
that it engulfed them. After you witnessed what I did to Egypt, and dwelt a
long time in the desert, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I brought you into the land of the Amorites who
lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I delivered them into
your power. You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them (the two
kings of the Amorites) before you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab,
prepared to war against Israel. He summoned Balaam, son of Beor, to curse you; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but I would not listen to Balaam. On the
contrary, he had to bless you, and I saved you from him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once you crossed the Jordan and came to
Jericho, the men of Jericho fought against you, but I delivered them also into
your power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-M9 href="__P62.HTM#$M9">2</a></sup></font></sup> And I sent the hornets ahead of you which
drove them (the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites,
Hivites and Jebusites) out of your way; it was not your sword or your bow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I gave you a land which you had not
tilled and cities which you had not built, to dwell in; you have eaten of
vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve
him completely and sincerely. Cast out the gods your fathers served beyond the
River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MA href="__P62.HTM#$MA">3</a></sup></font></sup> If it does not please you to serve the LORD,
decide today whom you will serve, the gods your fathers served beyond the River
or the gods of the Amorites in whose country you are dwelling. As for me and my
household, we will serve the LORD.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the people answered, &quot;Far be it from
us to forsake the LORD for the service of other gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For it was the LORD, our God, who brought us
and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of a state of slavery. He
performed those great miracles before our very eyes and protected us along our
entire journey and among all the peoples through whom we passed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At our approach the LORD drove out (all the
peoples, including) the Amorites who dwelt in the land. Therefore we also will
serve the LORD, for he is our God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MB href="__P62.HTM#$MB">4</a></sup></font></sup> Joshua in turn said to the people, &quot;You
may not be able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God
who will not forgive your transgressions or your sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, after the good he has done for you, you
forsake the LORD and serve strange gods, he will do evil to you and destroy
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the people answered Joshua, &quot;We will
still serve the LORD.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua therefore said to the people, &quot;You
are your own witnesses that you have chosen to serve the LORD.&quot; They
replied, &quot;We are, indeed!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now, therefore, put away the strange gods
that are among you and turn your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the people promised Joshua, &quot;We will
serve the LORD, our God, and obey his voice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that
day and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>which he recorded in the book of the law of
God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was in
the sanctuary of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Joshua said to all the people, &quot;This
stone shall be our witness, for it has heard all the words which the LORD spoke
to us. It shall be a witness against you, should you wish to deny your
God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his
own heritage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After these events, Joshua, son of Nun, servant
of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was buried within the limits of his heritage
at Timnath-serah in the mountain region of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel served the LORD during the entire
lifetime of Joshua and that of the elders who outlived Joshua and knew all that
the LORD had done for Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MC href="__P62.HTM#$MC">5</a></sup></font></sup> The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had
brought up from Egypt, were buried in Shechem in the plot of ground Jacob had
bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of
money. This was a heritage of the descendants of Joseph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Eleazar, son of Aaron, also died, he was
buried on the hill which had been given to his son Phinehas in the mountain
region of Ephraim. </p>
