<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and
placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and they came to him and said, &quot;Hail, King
of the Jews!&quot; And they struck him repeatedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once more Pilate went out and said to them,
&quot;Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no
guilt in him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the chief priests and the guards saw him
they cried out, &quot;Crucify him, crucify him!&quot; Pilate said to them,
&quot;Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3Y9 href="__PXR.HTM#$3Y9">2</a></sup></font></sup> The Jews answered, &quot;We have a law, and

God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became
even more afraid, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and went back into the praetorium and said to
Jesus, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; Jesus did not answer him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Pilate said to him, &quot;Do you not speak
to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to
crucify you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jesus answered (him), &quot;You would have no
power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the
one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but
the Jews cried out, &quot;If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YA href="__PXR.HTM#$3YA">3</a></sup></font></sup>
Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus
out and seated him <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YB href="__PXR.HTM#$3YB">4</a></sup></font></sup> on the judge's bench in the place
called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was preparation day for Passover, and it was
about noon. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YC href="__PXR.HTM#$3YC">5</a></sup></font></sup> And he said to the Jews, &quot;Behold, your
king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They cried out, &quot;Take him away, take him
away! Crucify him!&quot; Pilate said to them, &quot;Shall I crucify your
king?&quot; The chief priests answered, &quot;We have no king but Caesar.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he handed him over to them to be
crucified. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YD href="__PXR.HTM#$3YD">6</a></sup></font></sup> So they took Jesus, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17

he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There they crucified him, and with him two
others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YF href="__PXR.HTM#$3YF">8</a></sup></font></sup> Pilate also had an inscription written and put
on the cross. It read, &quot;Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now many of the Jews read this inscription,
because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was
written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the chief priests of the Jews said to
Pilate, &quot;Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am the
King of the Jews.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pilate answered, &quot;What I have written, I
have written.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YG href="__PXR.HTM#$3YG">9</a></sup></font></sup> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they
took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier. They
also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the
top down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they said to one another, &quot;Let's not
tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,&quot; in order that the
passage of scripture might be fulfilled (that says): &quot;They divided my
garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.&quot; This is what the
soldiers did. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jesus saw his mother <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YI href="__PXR.HTM#$3YI">11</a></sup></font></sup>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to the disciple, &quot;Behold,
your mother.&quot; And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, aware that everything was now
finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YJ href="__PXR.HTM#$3YJ">12</a></sup></font></sup>
Jesus said, &quot;I thirst.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was a vessel filled with common wine. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YK href="__PXR.HTM#$3YK">13</a></sup></font></sup>
So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his
mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YL href="__PXR.HTM#$3YL">14</a></sup></font></sup> When Jesus had taken the wine, he said,
&quot;It is finished.&quot; And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now since it was preparation day, in order that
the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for the sabbath day of
that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and
they be taken down. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the
first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was
already dead, they did not break his legs, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YM href="__PXR.HTM#$3YM">15</a></sup></font></sup> but one soldier thrust his lance into his
side, and immediately blood and water flowed out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony
is true; he knows <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YN href="__PXR.HTM#$3YN">16</a></sup></font></sup> that he is speaking the truth, so that
you also may (come to) believe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For this happened so that the scripture passage
might be fulfilled: &quot;Not a bone of it will be broken.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And again another passage says: &quot;They will
look upon him whom they have pierced.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3YO href="__PXR.HTM#$3YO">17</a></sup></font></sup> After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a
disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the
body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at
night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one
hundred pounds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took the body of Jesus and bound it with
burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now in the place where he had been crucified
there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been
buried. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish
preparation day; for the tomb was close by. </p>

the drugged wine, a narcotic that Jesus refused as the crucifixion began
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWH.HTM#GOSP.MAR.15.23"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 15:23), but only this final gesture of
kindness at the end (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWH.HTM#GOSP.MAR.15.36"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 15:36). Hyssop, a small
plant, is scarcely suitable for carrying a sponge (Mark mentions a reed) and
may be a symbolic reference to the hyssop used to daub the blood of the paschal
lamb on the doorpost of the Hebrews (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P1T.HTM#PENT.EXO.12.22"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus
12:22).</p>

is a double nuance of dying (giving up the last breath or spirit) and that of
passing on the holy Spirit; see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXF.HTM#GOSP.JOH.7.39"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 7:39 which
connects the giving of the Spirit with Jesus' glorious return to the Father,
and <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXS.HTM#GOSP.JOH.20.22"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 20:22 where the author portrays the
conferral of the Spirit.</p>

these verses to show the reality of Jesus' death, against the Docetist heretics.
In the blood and water there may also be a symbolic reference to the Eucharist
and baptism.</p>

from the Greek that this he is the eyewitness of the first part of the
sentence. May [come to] believe: see the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXS.HTM#GOSP.JOH.20.31"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John

there is no anointing on Friday. In Matthew and Luke the women come to the tomb
on Sunday morning precisely to anoint Jesus.</p>
