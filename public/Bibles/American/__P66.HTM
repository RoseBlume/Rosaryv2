<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The following are the nations which the LORD
allowed to remain, so that through them he might try all those Israelites who
had no experience of the battles with Canaan </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>training them in battle, those generations only
of the Israelites who would not have had that previous experience): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MJ href="__P66.HTM#$MJ">1</a></sup></font></sup> the five lords of the Philistines; and all the
Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwell in the mountain region of
Lebanon between Baal-hermon and the entrance to Hamath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These served to put Israel to the test, to
determine whether they would obey the commandments the LORD had enjoined on
their fathers through Moses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Besides, the Israelites were living among the Canaanites,
Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In fact, they took their daughters in marriage,
and gave their own daughters to their sons in marriage, and served their gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MK href="__P66.HTM#$MK">2</a></sup></font></sup> Because the Israelites had offended the LORD
by forgetting the LORD, their God, and serving the Baals and the Asherahs, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the anger of the LORD flared up against them,
and he allowed them to fall into the power of Cushan-rishathaim, king of Aram
Naharaim, whom they served for eight years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD,
he raised up for them a savior, Othniel, son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz,
who rescued them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he
judged Israel. When he went out to war, the LORD delivered Cushan-risha-thaim,
king of Aram, into his power, so that he made him subject. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The land then was at rest for forty years,
until Othniel, son of Kenaz, died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again the Israelites offended the LORD, who
because of this offense strengthened Eglon, king of Moab, against Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In alliance with the Ammonites and Amalekites,
he attacked and defeated Israel, taking possession of the city of palms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites then served Eglon, king of Moab,
for eighteen years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD,
he raised up for them a savior, the Benjaminite Ehud, son of Gera, who was
left-handed. It was by him that the Israelites sent their tribute to Eglon,
king of Moab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ehud made himself a two-edged dagger a foot
long, and wore it under his clothes over his right thigh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He presented the tribute to Eglon, king of
Moab, who was very fat, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and after the presentation went off with the
tribute bearers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He returned, however, from where the idols are,
near Gilgal, and said, &quot;I have a private message for you, O king.&quot;
And the king said, &quot;Silence!&quot; Then when all his attendants had left
his presence, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Ehud went in to him where he sat alone in
his cool upper room, Ehud said, &quot;I have a message from God for you.&quot;
So the king rose from his chair, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and then Ehud with his left hand drew the
dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon's belly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The hilt also went in after the blade, and the
fat closed over the blade because he did not withdraw the dagger from his body.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ehud went out into the hall, shutting the
doors of the upper room on him and locking them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Ehud had left and the servants came, they
saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, and thought, &quot;He must be
easing himself in the cool chamber.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They waited until they finally grew suspicious.
Since he did not open the doors of the upper room, they took the key and opened
them. There on the floor, dead, lay their lord! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During their delay Ehud made good his escape
and, passing the idols, took refuge in Seirah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On his arrival he sounded the horn in the
mountain region of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down from the mountains
with him as their leader. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Follow me,&quot; he said to them,
&quot;for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your
power.&quot; So they followed him down and seized the fords of the Jordan leading
to Moab, permitting no one to cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On that occasion they slew about ten thousand
Moabites, all of them strong and valiant men. Not a man escaped. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus was Moab brought under the power of Israel
at that time; and the land had rest for eighty years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After him there was Shamgar, son of Anath, who
slew six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He, too, rescued Israel. </p>
