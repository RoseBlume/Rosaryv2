<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 22</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah,
his youngest son, king in his stead, since all the older sons had been slain by
the band that had come into the fort with the Arabs. Thus Ahaziah, son of
Jehoram, reigned as the king of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was twenty-two years old when he became
king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother was named Athaliah,
daughter of Omri. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He, too, followed the ways of the house of
Ahab, because his mother counseled him to act sinfully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To his own destruction, he did evil in the
sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab, since they were his counselors
after the death of his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was also following their counsel when he
accompanied Jehoram, son of Ahab, king of Israel, to battle against Hazael,
king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead. There Jehoram was wounded by the Arameans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He returned to Jezreel to be healed of the
wounds he had received at Rama in his battle against Hazael, king of Aram.
Because of this illness, Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to
visit Jehoram, son of Ahab, in Jezreel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now it was willed by God for Ahaziah's downfall
that he should join Jehoram, for after his arrival he rode out with Jehoram to
Jehu, son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut down the house of Ahab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While Jehu was executing judgment on the house
of Ahab, he also encountered the princes of Judah and the nephews of Ahaziah
who were his attendants, and he slew them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WT href="__PB6.HTM#$WT">1</a></sup></font></sup> Then he looked for Ahaziah himself. They
caught him where he was hiding in Samaria and brought him to Jehu, who put him
to death. They buried him, for they said, &quot;He was the grandson of
Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with his whole heart.&quot; There remained in
Ahaziah's house no one powerful enough to wield the kingship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Athaliah, mother of Ahaziah, learned that
her son was dead, she proceeded to kill off all the royal offspring of the
house of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jehosheba, a royal princess, secretly took
Ahaziah's son Joash from among the king's sons who were about to be slain, and
put him and his nurse in a bedroom. In this way Jehosheba, who was the daughter
of King Jehoram, a sister of Ahaziah, and wife of Jehoiada the priest, hid the
child from Athaliah's sight, so that she did not put him to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For six years he remained hidden with them in
the house of God, while Athaliah ruled over the land. </p>
