<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this Absalom provided himself with
chariots, horses, and fifty henchmen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, Absalom used to rise early and stand
alongside the road leading to the gate. If someone had a lawsuit to be decided
by the king, Absalom would call to him and say, &quot;From what city are
you?&quot; And when he replied, &quot;Your servant is of such and such a tribe
of Israel,&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom would say to him, &quot;Your suit is
good and just, but there is no one to hear you in the king's name.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he would continue: &quot;If only I could be
appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a lawsuit to be decided
might come to me and I would render him justice.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whenever a man approached him to show homage,
he would extend his hand, hold him, and kiss him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By behaving in this way toward all the
Israelites who came to the king for judgment, Absalom was stealing away the
loyalties of the men of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After a period of four years, Absalom said to
the king: &quot;Allow me to go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For while living in Geshur in Aram, your
servant made this vow: 'If the LORD ever brings me back to Jerusalem, I will
worship him in Hebron.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king wished him a safe journey, and he went
off to Hebron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes
of Israel to say, &quot;When you hear the sound of the horn, declare Absalom
king in Hebron.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Two hundred men had accompanied Absalom from
Jerusalem. They had been invited and went in good faith, knowing nothing of the
plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom also sent to Ahithophel the Gilonite,
David's counselor, an invitation to come from his town, Giloh, for the
sacrifices he was about to offer. So the conspiracy gained strength, and the
people with Absalom increased in numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>An informant came to David with the report,
&quot;The Israelites have transferred their loyalty to Absalom.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this, David said to all his servants who
were with him in Jerusalem: &quot;Up! Let us take flight, or none of us will
escape from Absalom. Leave quickly, lest he hurry and overtake us, then visit
disaster upon us and put the city to the sword.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king's officers answered him, &quot;Your
servants are ready, whatever our lord the king chooses to do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king set out, accompanied by his
entire household, except for ten concubines whom he left behind to take care of
the palace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the king left the city, with all his
officers accompanying him, they halted opposite the ascent of the Mount of
Olives, at a distance, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>while the whole army marched past him.As all
the Cherethites and Pelethites, and the six hundred men of Gath who had
accompanied him from that city, were passing in review before the king, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said to Ittai the Gittite: &quot;Why should
you also go with us? Go back and stay with the king, for you are a foreigner
and you, too, are an exile from your own country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You came only yesterday, and shall I have you
wander about with us today, wherever I have to go? Return and take your
brothers with you, and may the LORD be kind and faithful to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Ittai answered the king, &quot;As the LORD
lives, and as my lord the king lives, your servant shall be wherever my lord
the king may be, whether for death or for life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king said to Ittai, &quot;Go, then,
march on.&quot; And Ittai the Gittite, with all his men and all the dependents
that were with him, marched on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Everyone in the countryside wept aloud as the
last of the soldiers went by, and the king crossed the Kidron Valley with all
the soldiers moving on ahead of him by way of the Mount of Olives, toward the
desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zadok, too (with all the Levite bearers of the
ark of the covenant of God), and Abiathar brought the ark of God to a halt
until the soldiers had marched out of the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said to Zadok: &quot;Take the ark
of God back to the city. If I find favor with the LORD, he will bring me back
and permit me to see it and its lodging. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if he should say, 'I am not pleased with
you,' I am ready; let him do to me as he sees fit.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king also said to the priest Zadok:
&quot;See to it that you and Abiathar return to the city in peace, and both
your sons with you, your own son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar's son Jonathan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Remember, I shall be waiting at the fords near
the desert until I receive information from you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back
to Jerusalem and remained there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As David went up the Mount of Olives, he wept
without ceasing. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. All those
who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David was informed that Ahithophel was
among the conspirators with Absalom, he said, &quot;O LORD, turn the counsel of
Ahithophel to folly!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When David reached the top, where men used to
worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him, with rent garments and
dirt upon his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to him: &quot;If you come with me,
you will be a burden to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you return to the city and say to Absalom,
'Let me be your servant, O king; I was formerly your father's servant, but now
I will be yours,' you will undo for me the counsel of Ahithophel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You will have the priests Zadok and Abiathar
there with you. If you hear anything from the royal palace, you shall report it
to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who have there with them both Zadok's son
Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. Through them you shall send on to me
whatever you hear.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So David's friend Hushai went into the city of
Jerusalem as Absalom was about to enter it. </p>
