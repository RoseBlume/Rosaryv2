<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-OZ href="__P6Y.HTM#$OZ">1</a></sup></font></sup> and Samuel spoke to all Israel. <br>
At that time, the Philistines gathered for an attack on Israel. Israel went out
to engage them in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped
at Aphek.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines then drew up in battle
formation against Israel. After a fierce struggle Israel was defeated by the
Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the battlefield. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the troops retired to the camp, the elders
of Israel said, &quot;Why has the LORD permitted us to be defeated today by the
Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the LORD from Shiloh that it may go into
battle among us and save us from the grasp of our enemies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P0 href="__P6Y.HTM#$P0">2</a></sup></font></sup> So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from
there the ark of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned upon the cherubim. The two
sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were with the ark of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the ark of the LORD arrived in the camp,
all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth resounded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines, hearing the noise of shouting,
asked, &quot;What can this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?&quot;
On learning that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Philistines were frightened. They said,
&quot;Gods have come to their camp.&quot; They said also, &quot;Woe to us! This
has never happened before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-P1 href="__P6Y.HTM#$P1">3</a></sup></font></sup> Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power
of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with various
plagues and with pestilence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take courage and be manly, Philistines;
otherwise you will become slaves to the Hebrews, as they were your slaves. So
fight manfully!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines fought and Israel was defeated;
every man fled to his own tent. It was a disastrous defeat, in which Israel
lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two
sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were among the dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A Benjaminite fled from the battlefield and
reached Shiloh that same day, with his clothes torn and his head covered with
dirt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he arrived, Eli was sitting in his chair
beside the gate, watching the road, for he was troubled at heart about the ark
of God. The man, however, went into the city to divulge his news, which put the
whole city in an uproar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hearing the outcry of the men standing near
him, Eli inquired, &quot;What does this commotion mean?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes
would not focus, so that he could not see.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The man quickly came up to Eli and said,
&quot;It is I who have come from the battlefield; I fled from there
today.&quot; He asked, &quot;What happened, my son?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the messenger answered: &quot;Israel fled
from the Philistines; in fact, the troops suffered heavy losses. Your two sons,
Hophni and Phinehas, are among the dead, and the ark of God has been
captured.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this mention of the ark of God, Eli fell
backward from his chair into the gateway; since he was an old man and heavy, he
died of a broken neck. He had judged Israel for forty years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was
with child and at the point of giving birth. When she heard the news concerning
the capture of the ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she
was seized with the pangs of labor, and gave birth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She was about to die when the women standing
around her said to her, &quot;Never fear! You have given birth to a son.&quot;
Yet she neither answered nor paid any attention. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(She named the child Ichabod, saying,
&quot;Gone is the glory from Israel,&quot; with reference to the capture of the
ark of God and to her father-in-law and her husband.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She said, &quot;Gone is the glory from
Israel,&quot; because the ark of God had been captured. </p>
