<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the New Testament canon, between the Acts of the Apostles and
Revelation, there are twenty-one documents that take the form of letters or
epistles. Most of these are actual letters, but some are more like treatises in
the guise of letters. In a few cases even some of the more obvious elements of
the letter form are absent; see the Introductions to Hebrews and to 1 John. </p>

<p>The virtually standard form
found in these documents, though with some variation, is dependent upon the
conventions of letter writing common in the ancient world, but these were
modified to suit the purposes of Christian writers. The New Testament letters
usually begin with a greeting including an identification of the sender or
senders and of the recipients. Next comes a prayer, usually in the form of a
thanksgiving. The body of the letter provides an exposition of Christian
teaching, usually provoked by concrete circumstances, and generally also draws
conclusions regarding ethical behavior. There often follows a discussion of
practical matters, such as the writer's travel plans, and the letter concludes
with further advice and a formula of farewell.</p>

<p>Fourteen of the twenty-one
letters have been traditionally attributed to Paul. One of these, the Letter to
the Hebrews, does not itself claim to be the work of Paul; when it was accepted
into the canon after much discussion, it was attached at the very end of the
Pauline corpus. The other thirteen identify Paul as their author, but most
scholars believe that some of them were actually written by his disciples; see
the Introductions to Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, and 1 Timothy.</p>

<p>Four of the letters in the
Pauline corpus (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon) are called
the &quot;Captivity Epistles&quot; because in each of them the author speaks of
being in prison at the time of writing. Three others (1-2 Timothy and Titus)
are known as the &quot;Pastoral Epistles&quot; because, addressed to
individuals rather than communities, they give advice to disciples about caring
for the flock. The letters of the Pauline corpus are arranged in roughly
descending order of length from Romans to Philemon, with Hebrews added at the
end.</p>

<p>The other seven letters of
the New Testament that follow the Pauline corpus are collectively referred to
as the &quot;Catholic Epistles.&quot; This term, which means
&quot;universal,&quot; refers to the fact that most of them are directed not to
a single Christian community, as are most of the Pauline letters, but to a
wider audience; see the Introduction to the catholic letters. Three of them
(1-2-3 John) are closely related to the fourth gospel and thus belong to the
Johannine corpus. The catholic letters, like those of the Pauline corpus, are
also arranged in roughly descending order of length, but the three Johannine
letters are kept together and Jude is placed at the end.</p>

<p>The genuine letters of Paul
are earlier in date than any of our written gospels. The dates of the other New
Testament letters are more difficult to determine, but for the most part they
belong to the second and third Christian generations rather than to the
first.</p>
