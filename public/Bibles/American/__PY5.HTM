<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-425 href="__PY5.HTM#$425">1</a></sup></font></sup> Now the apostles and the brothers who were in
Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem the
circumcised believers confronted him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>saying, &quot;You entered <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-426 href="__PY5.HTM#$426">2</a></sup></font></sup>
the house of uncircumcised people and ate with them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Peter began and explained it to them step by
step, saying, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I was at prayer in the city of Joppa when
in a trance I had a vision, something resembling a large sheet coming down,
lowered from the sky by its four corners, and it came to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Looking intently into it, I observed and saw
the four-legged animals of the earth, the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the
birds of the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I also heard a voice say to me, 'Get up, Peter.
Slaughter and eat.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I said, 'Certainly not, sir, because
nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But a second time a voice from heaven answered,
'What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This happened three times, and then everything
was drawn up again into the sky. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Just then three men appeared at the house where
we were, who had been sent to me from Caesarea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Spirit told me to accompany them without
discriminating. These six brothers <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-427 href="__PY5.HTM#$427">3</a></sup></font></sup> also went with me, and
we entered the man's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He related to us how he had seen (the) angel
standing in his house, saying, 'Send someone to Joppa and summon Simon, who is
called Peter, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who will speak words to you by which you and
all your household will be saved.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell upon
them as it had upon us at the beginning, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he
had said, 'John baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy
Spirit.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If then God gave them the same gift he gave to
us when we came to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to
hinder God?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this, they stopped objecting
and glorified God, saying, &quot;God has then granted life-giving repentance to
the Gentiles too.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-428 href="__PY5.HTM#$428">4</a></sup></font></sup> Now those who had been scattered by the
persecution that arose because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and
Antioch, preaching the word to no one but Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were some Cypriots and Cyrenians among
them, however, who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks as well, proclaiming
the Lord Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The hand of the Lord was with them and a great
number who believed turned to the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The news about them reached the ears of the
church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas (to go) to Antioch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he
rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord in firmness of
heart, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for he was a good man, filled with the holy
Spirit and faith. And a large number of people was added to the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and when he had found him he brought him to
Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large number of
people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians. <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-429 href="__PY5.HTM#$429">5</a></sup></font></sup>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42A href="__PY5.HTM#$42A">6</a></sup></font></sup> At that time some prophets came down from
Jerusalem to Antioch, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and one of them named Agabus stood up and

and it happened under Claudius. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the disciples determined that, according to
ability, each should send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42B href="__PY5.HTM#$42B">7</a></sup></font></sup> This they did, sending it to the presbyters in

Jerusalem were scandalized to learn of Peter's sojourn in the house of the
Gentile Cornelius. Nonetheless, they had to accept the divine directions given
to both Peter and Cornelius. They concluded that the setting aside of the legal
barriers between Jew and Gentile was an exceptional ordinance of God to
indicate that the apostolic kerygma was also to be directed to the Gentiles.
Only in Acts 15 at the &quot;Council&quot; in Jerusalem does the evangelization
of the Gentiles become the official position of the church leadership in
Jerusalem. </p>

antipathy to the mixed community was reflected by the early missionaries
generally. The few among them who entertained a different view succeeded in
introducing Gentiles into the community at Antioch (in Syria). When the
disconcerted Jerusalem community sent Barnabas to investigate, he was so
favorably impressed by what he observed that he persuaded his friend Saul to
participate in the Antioch mission.</p>

prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch to request help in view of the coming
famine or whether they received this insight during their visit there. The
former supposition seems more likely. Suetonius and Tacitus speak of famines
during the reign of Claudius (A.D. 41-54), while the Jewish historian Josephus
mentions a famine in Judea in A.D. Acts
11:46-48. Luke is interested, rather, in showing the charity of the
Antiochene community toward the Jewish Christians of Jerusalem despite their
differences on mixed communities.</p>

reference to the Jewish community.</p>
