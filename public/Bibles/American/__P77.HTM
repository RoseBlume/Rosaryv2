<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PI href="__P77.HTM#$PI">1</a></sup></font></sup> (Saul was. . . years old when he became king
and he reigned. . . (two) years over Israel.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul chose three thousand men of Israel, of
whom two thousand remained with him in Michmash and in the hill country of
Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the
rest of the people back to their tents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PJ href="__P77.HTM#$PJ">2</a></sup></font></sup> Now Jonathan overcame the Philistine garrison
which was in Gibeah, and the Philistines got word of it. Then Saul sounded the
horn throughout the land, with a proclamation, &quot;Let the Hebrews
hear!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus all Israel learned that Saul had overcome
the garrison of the Philistines and that Israel had brought disgrace upon the
Philistines; and the soldiers were called up to Saul in Gilgal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistines also assembled for battle, with
three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and foot soldiers as numerous
as the sands of the seashore. Moving up against Israel, they encamped in
Michmash, east of Beth-aven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some Israelites, aware of the danger and of the
difficult situation, hid themselves in caves, in thickets, among rocks, in
caverns, and in cisterns, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PK href="__P77.HTM#$PK">3</a></sup></font></sup> and other Hebrews passed over the Jordan into
the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, held out at Gilgal, although all his
followers were seized with fear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He waited seven days - the time Samuel had
determined. When Samuel did not arrive at Gilgal, the men began to slip away
from Saul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then said, &quot;Bring me the holocaust and
peace offerings,&quot; and he offered up the holocaust. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had just finished this offering when Samuel
arrived. Saul went out to greet him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Samuel asked him, &quot;What have you
done?&quot; Saul replied: &quot;When I saw that the men were slipping away from
me, since you had not come by the specified time, and with the Philistines
assembled at Michmash, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I said to myself, 'Now the Philistines will
come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not yet sought the LORD'S blessing.'
So in my anxiety I offered up the holocaust.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel's response was: &quot;You have been
foolish! Had you kept the command the LORD your God gave you, the LORD would
now establish your kingship in Israel as lasting; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but as things are, your kingdom shall not endure.
The LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and has appointed him
commander of his people, because you broke the LORD'S command.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went his
own way; but the rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the soldiers,
going from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul then numbered the soldiers he had
with him, who were about six hundred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul, his son Jonathan, and the soldiers they
had with them were now occupying Geba of Benjamin, and the Philistines were
encamped at Michmash. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Meanwhile, raiders left the camp of the
Philistines in three bands. One band took the Ophrah road toward the district
of Shual; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>another turned in the direction of Beth-horon;
and the third took the road for Geba that overlooks the Valley of the Hyenas
toward the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Not a single smith was to be found in the whole
land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, &quot;Otherwise the Hebrews will
make swords or spears.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All Israel, therefore, had to go down to the
Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The price for the plowshares and mattocks was two-thirds
of a shekel, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting
the ox-goads. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And so on the day of battle neither sword nor
spear could be found in the possession of any of the soldiers with Saul or
Jonathan. Only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>An outpost of the Philistines had pushed
forward to the pass of Michmash. </p>
