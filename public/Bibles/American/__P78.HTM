<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One day Jonathan, son of Saul, said to his
armor-bearer, &quot;Come let us go over to the Philistine outpost on the other
side.&quot; But he did not inform his father. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Saul's command post was under the pomegranate
tree near the threshing floor on the outskirts of Geba; those with him numbered
about six hundred men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahijah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, who
was the son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD at Shiloh, was
wearing the ephod.) Nor did the soldiers know that Jonathan had gone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Flanking the ravine through which Jonathan
intended to get over to the Philistine outpost there was a rocky crag on each
side, one called Bozez, the other Seneh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One crag was to the north, toward Michmash, the
other to the south, toward Geba. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan said to his armor-bearer: &quot;Come
let us go over to that outpost of the uncircumcised. Perhaps the LORD will help
us, because it is no more difficult for the LORD to grant victory through a few
than through many.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His armor-bearer replied, &quot;Do whatever you
are inclined to do; I will match your resolve.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan continued: &quot;We shall go over to
those men and show ourselves to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If they say to us, 'Stay there until we can
come to you,' we shall stop where we are; we shall not go up to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we shall go
up, because the LORD has delivered them into our grasp. That will be our
sign.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly, the two of them appeared before
the outpost of the Philistines, who said, &quot;Look, some Hebrews are coming
out of the holes where they have been hiding.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The men of the outpost called to Jonathan and
his armor-bearer. &quot;Come up here,&quot; they said, &quot;and we will teach
you a lesson.&quot; So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, &quot;Climb up after
me, for the LORD has delivered them into the grasp of Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan clambered up with his armor-bearer
behind him; as the Philistines turned to flee him, he cut them down, and his
armor-bearer followed him and finished them off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In this first exploit Jonathan and his
armor-bearer slew about twenty men within half a furlong. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then panic spread to the army and to the
countryside, and all the soldiers, including the outpost and the raiding
parties, were terror-stricken. The earth also shook, so that the panic was
beyond human endurance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The lookouts of Saul in Geba of Benjamin saw
that the enemy camp had scattered and were running about in all directions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul said to those around him, &quot;Count the
troops and find out if any of us are missing.&quot; When they had investigated,
they found Jonathan and his armor-bearer missing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PL href="__P78.HTM#$PL">1</a></sup></font></sup> Saul then said to Ahijah, &quot;Bring the
ephod here.&quot; (Ahijah was wearing the ephod in front of the Israelites at
that time.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While Saul was speaking to the priest, the
tumult in the Philistine camp kept increasing. So he said to the priest,
&quot;Withdraw your hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Saul and all his men shouted and rushed
into the fight, where the Philistines, wholly confused, were thrusting swords
at one another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In addition, the Hebrews who had previously
sided with the Philistines and had gone up with them to the camp, turned to
join the Israelites under Saul and Jonathan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Likewise, all the Israelites who were hiding in
the hill country of Ephraim, on hearing that the Philistines were fleeing,
pursued them in the rout. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PM href="__P78.HTM#$PM">2</a></sup></font></sup> Thus the LORD saved Israel that day. The
battle continued past Beth-horon; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the whole people, about ten thousand
combatants, were with Saul, and there was scattered fighting in every town in
the hill country of Ephraim. And Saul swore a very rash oath that day, putting
the people under this ban: &quot;Cursed be the man who takes food before
evening, before I am able to avenge myself on my enemies.&quot; So none of the
people tasted food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Indeed, there was a honeycomb lying on the
ground, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and when the soldiers came to the comb the
swarm had left it; yet no one would raise a hand to his mouth from it, because
the people feared the oath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan, who had not heard that his father had
put the people under oath, thrust out the end of the staff he was holding and
dipped in into the honey. Then he raised it to his mouth and his eyes lit up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this one of the soldiers spoke up:
&quot;Your father put the people under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be the
man who takes food this day!' As a result the people are weak.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan replied: &quot;My father brings
trouble to the land. Look how bright my eyes are from this small taste of honey
I have had. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>What is more, if the people had eaten freely
today of their enemy's booty when they came across it, would not the slaughter
of the Philistines by now have been the greater for it?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After the Philistines were routed that day from
Michmash to Aijalon, the people were completely exhausted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they pounced upon the spoil and took sheep,
oxen and calves, slaughtering them on the ground and eating the flesh with
blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Informed that the people were sinning against
the LORD by eating the flesh with blood, Saul said: &quot;You have broken
faith. Roll a large stone here for me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He continued: &quot;Mingle with the people and
tell each of them to bring his ox or his sheep to me. Slaughter it here and
then eat, but you must not sin against the LORD by eating the flesh with
blood.&quot; So everyone brought to the LORD whatever ox he had seized, and
they slaughtered them there; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Saul built an altar to the LORD - this was
the first time he built an altar to the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul said, &quot;Let us go down in pursuit
of the Philistines by night, to plunder among them until daybreak and to kill
them all off.&quot; They replied, &quot;Do what you think best.&quot; But the
priest said, &quot;Let us consult God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Saul inquired of God: &quot;Shall I go down
in pursuit of the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the power of
Israel?&quot; But he received no answer on this occasion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then said, &quot;Come here, all officers
of the army. We must investigate and find out how this sin was committed today.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the LORD lives who has given victory to
Israel, even if my son Jonathan has committed it, he shall surely die!&quot;
But none of the people answered him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said to all Israel, &quot;Stand on one
side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other.&quot; The people
responded, &quot;Do what you think best.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PN href="__P78.HTM#$PN">3</a></sup></font></sup> And Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel:
&quot;Why did you not answer your servant this time? If the blame for this
resides in me or my son Jonathan, LORD, God of Israel, respond with Urim; but
if this guilt is in your people Israel, respond with Thummim.&quot; Jonathan
and Saul were designated, and the people went free. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul then said, &quot;Cast lots between me and
my son Jonathan.&quot; And Jonathan was designated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul said to Jonathan, &quot;Tell me what you
have done.&quot; Jonathan replied, &quot;I only tasted a little honey from the
end of the staff I was holding. Am I to die for this?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul said, &quot;May God do thus and so to me
if you do not indeed die, Jonathan!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PO href="__P78.HTM#$PO">4</a></sup></font></sup> But the army said to Saul: &quot;Is Jonathan
to die, though it was he who brought Israel this great victory? This must not
be! As the LORD lives, not a single hair of his head shall fall to the ground,
for God was with him in what he did today!&quot; Thus the soldiers were able to
rescue Jonathan from death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After that Saul gave up the pursuit of the
Philistines, who returned to their own territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After taking over the kingship of Israel, Saul
waged war on all their surrounding enemies - Moab, the Ammonites, Aram,
Beth-rehob, the king of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he was
successful </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and fought bravely. He defeated Amalek and
delivered Israel from the hands of those who were plundering them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-PP href="__P78.HTM#$PP">5</a></sup></font></sup> The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and
Malchishua; his two daughters were named, the elder, Merob, and the younger, Michal.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul's wife, who was named Ahinoam, was the
daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of his general was Abner, son of Saul's uncle,
Ner; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Kish, Saul's father, and Ner, Abner's father,
were sons of Abiel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>An unremitting war was waged against the
Philistines during Saul's lifetime. When Saul saw any strong or brave man, he
took him into his service. </p>
