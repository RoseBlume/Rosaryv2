<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 18</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Long afterward, in the third year, the LORD
spoke to Elijah, &quot;Go, present yourself to Ahab,&quot; he said, &quot;that
I may send rain upon the earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the famine in Samaria was bitter, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, his vizier, who
was a zealous follower of the LORD. When Jezebel was murdering the prophets of
the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets, hid them away fifty each in two
caves, and supplied them with food and drink. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab said to Obadiah, &quot;Come, let us go
through the land to all sources of water and to all the streams. We may find
grass and save the horses and mules, so that we shall not have to slaughter any
of the beasts.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Dividing the land to explore between them, Ahab
went one way by himself, Obadiah another way by himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Obadiah was on his way, Elijah met him.
Recognizing him, Obadiah fell prostrate and asked, &quot;Is it you, my lord
Elijah?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered. &quot;Go tell
your master, 'Elijah is here!'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Obadiah said, &quot;What sin have I
committed, that you are handing me over to Ahab to have me killed? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the LORD, your God, lives, there is no
nation or kingdom where my master has not sent in search of you. When they
replied, 'He is not here,' he made each kingdom and nation swear they could not
find you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now you say, 'Go tell your master: Elijah
is here!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After I leave you, the spirit of the LORD will
carry you to some place I do not know, and when I go to inform Ahab and he does
not find you, he will kill me. Your servant has revered the LORD from his
youth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Have you not been told, my lord, what I did
when Jezebel was murdering the prophets of the LORD - that I hid a hundred of
the prophets of the LORD, fifty each in two caves, and supplied them with food
and drink? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now you say, 'Go tell your master: Elijah
is here!' He will kill me!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elijah answered, &quot;As the LORD of hosts
lives, whom I serve, I will present myself to him today.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and informed him.
Ahab came to meet Elijah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and when he saw Elijah, said to him, &quot;Is
it you, you disturber of Israel?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;It is not I who disturb Israel,&quot; he
answered, &quot;but you and your family, by forsaking the commands of the LORD
and following the Baals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now summon all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, as
well as the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred
prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Ahab sent to all the Israelites and had the
prophets assemble on Mount Carmel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elijah appealed to all the people and said,
&quot;How long will you straddle the issue? If the LORD is God, follow him; if
Baal, follow him.&quot; The people, however, did not answer him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Elijah said to the people, &quot;I am the
only surviving prophet of the LORD, and there are four hundred and fifty
prophets of Baal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give us two young bulls. Let them choose one,
cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood, but start no fire. I shall
prepare the other and place it on the wood, but shall start no fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall call on the name of your gods, and I
will call on the name of the LORD. The God who answers with fire is God.&quot;
All the people answered, &quot;Agreed!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elijah then said to the prophets of Baal,
&quot;Choose one young bull and prepare it first, for there are more of you.
Call upon your gods, but do not start the fire.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Taking the young bull that was turned over to
them, they prepared it and called on Baal from morning to noon, saying,
&quot;Answer us, Baal!&quot; But there was no sound, and no one answering. And
they hopped around the altar they had prepared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When it was noon, Elijah taunted them:
&quot;Call louder, for he is a god and may be meditating, or may have retired,
or may be on a journey. Perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They called out louder and slashed themselves
with swords and spears, as was their custom, until blood gushed over them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Noon passed and they remained in a prophetic
state until the time for offering sacrifice. But there was not a sound; no one
answered, and no one was listening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Elijah said to all the people, &quot;Come
here to me.&quot; When they had done so, he repaired the altar of the LORD
which had been destroyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He took twelve stones, for the number of tribes
of the sons of Jacob, to whom the LORD had said, &quot;Your name shall be
Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He built an altar in honor of the LORD with the
stones, and made a trench around the altar large enough for two seahs of grain.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had arranged the wood, he cut up the
young bull and laid it on the wood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Fill four jars with water,&quot; he said,
&quot;and pour it over the holocaust and over the wood.&quot; &quot;Do it
again,&quot; he said, and they did it again. &quot;Do it a third time,&quot; he
said, and they did it a third time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The water flowed around the altar, and the
trench was filled with the water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the time for offering sacrifice, the prophet
Elijah came forward and said, &quot;LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
let it be known this day that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant
and have done all these things by your command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Answer me, LORD! Answer me, that this people
may know that you, LORD, are God and that you have brought them back to their
senses.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD'S fire came down and consumed the
holocaust, wood, stones, and dust, and it lapped up the water in the trench. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seeing this, all the people fell prostrate and
said, &quot;The LORD is God! The LORD is God!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Elijah said to them, &quot;Seize the
prophets of Baal. Let none of them escape!&quot; They were seized, and Elijah
had them brought down to the brook Kishon and there he slit their throats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elijah then said to Ahab, &quot;Go up, eat and
drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Ahab went up to eat and drink, while Elijah
climbed to the top of Carmel, crouched down to the earth, and put his head
between his knees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Climb up and look out to sea,&quot; he
directed his servant, who went up and looked, but reported, &quot;There is
nothing.&quot; Seven times he said, &quot;Go look again!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the seventh time the youth reported,
&quot;There is a cloud as small as a man's hand rising from the sea.&quot;
Elijah said, &quot;Go and say to Ahab, 'Harness up and leave the mountain
before the rain stops you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In a trice, the sky grew dark with clouds and
wind, and a heavy rain fell. Ahab mounted his chariot and made for Jezreel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, who
girded up his clothing and ran before Ahab as far as the approaches to Jezreel.
