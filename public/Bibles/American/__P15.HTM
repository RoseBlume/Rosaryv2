<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5X href="__P15.HTM#$5X">1</a></sup></font></sup> When Joseph was taken down to Egypt, a certain
Egyptian (Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh and his chief steward) bought him
from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But since the LORD was with him, Joseph got on
very well and was assigned to the household of his Egyptian master. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his master saw that the LORD was with him
and brought him success in whatever he did, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he took a liking to Joseph and made him his
personal attendant; he put him in charge of his household and entrusted to him
all his possessions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the moment that he put him in charge of
his household and all his possessions, the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house
for Joseph's sake; in fact, the LORD'S blessing was on everything he owned,
both inside the house and out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Having left everything he owned in Joseph's
charge, he gave no thought, with Joseph there, to anything but the food he ate.
Now Joseph was strikingly handsome in countenance and body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After a time, his master's wife began to look
fondly at him and said, &quot;Lie with me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he refused. &quot;As long as I am
here,&quot; he told her, &quot;my master does not concern himself with anything
in the house, but has entrusted to me all he owns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He wields no more authority in this house than
I do, and he has withheld from me nothing but yourself, since you are his wife.
How, then, could I commit so great a wrong and thus stand condemned before
God?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Although she tried to entice him day after day,
he would not agree to lie beside her, or even stay near her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One such day, when Joseph came into the house
to do his work, and none of the household servants were then in the house, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>she laid hold of him by his cloak, saying,
&quot;Lie with me!&quot; But leaving the cloak in her hand, he got away from
her and ran outside. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When she saw that he had left his cloak in her
hand as he fled outside, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>she screamed for her household servants and
told them, &quot;Look! my husband has brought in a Hebrew slave to make sport
of us! He came in here to lie with me, but I cried out as loud as I could. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he heard me scream for help, he left his
cloak beside me and ran away outside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She kept the cloak with her until his master
came home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then she told him the same story: &quot;The
Hebrew slave whom you brought here broke in on me, to make sport of me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when I screamed for help, he left his cloak
beside me and fled outside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As soon as the master heard his wife's story
about how his slave had treated her, he became enraged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He seized Joseph and threw him into the jail
where the royal prisoners were confined. But even while he was in prison, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the LORD remained with Joseph; he showed him
kindness by making the chief jailer well-disposed toward him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The chief jailer put Joseph in charge of all
the prisoners in the jail, and everything that had to be done there was done under
his management. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The chief jailer did not concern himself with
anything at all that was in Joseph's charge, since the LORD was with him and
brought success to all he did. </p>
