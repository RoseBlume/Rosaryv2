<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YJ href="__PCB.HTM#$YJ">1</a></sup></font></sup> This book tells the story of Tobit, son of
Tobiel, son of Hananiel, son of Aduel, son of Gabael of the family of Asiel, of
the tribe of Naphtali, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who during the reign of Shalmaneser, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YK href="__PCB.HTM#$YK">2</a></sup></font></sup>
king of Assyria, was taken captive from Thisbe, which is south of Kedesh
Naphtali in upper Galilee, above and to the west of Asser, north of Phogor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I, Tobit, have walked all the days of my life
on the paths of truth and righteousness. I performed many charitable works for
my kinsmen and my people who had been deported with me to Nineveh, in Assyria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I lived as a young man in my own country,
Israel, the entire tribe of my forefather Naphtali had broken away from the
house of David and from Jerusalem. This city had been singled out of all
Israel's tribes, so that they all might offer sacrifice in the place where the
temple, God's dwelling, had been built and consecrated for all generations to
come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YL href="__PCB.HTM#$YL">3</a></sup></font></sup> All my kinsmen, like the rest of the tribe of
my forefather Naphtali, used to offer sacrifice on all the mountains of Galilee
as well as to the young bull which Jeroboam, king of Israel, had made in Dan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YM href="__PCB.HTM#$YM">4</a></sup></font></sup> I, for my part, would often make the
pilgrimage alone to Jerusalem for the festivals, as is prescribed for all
Israel by perpetual decree. Bringing with me the first fruits of the field and
the firstlings of the flock, together with a tenth of my income and the first
shearings of the sheep, I would hasten to Jerusalem </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and present them to the priests, Aaron's sons,
at the altar. To the Levites who were doing service in Jeusalem I would give
the tithe of grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruits. And
except for sabbatical years, I used to give a second tithe in money, which each
year I would go and disburse in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The third tithe I gave to orphans and widows,
and to converts who were living with the Israelites. Every third year I would
bring them this offering, and we ate it in keeping with the decree of the
Mosaic law and the commands of Deborah, the mother of my father Tobiel; for
when my father died, he left me an orphan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I reached manhood, I married Anna, a woman
of our own lineage. By her I had a son whom I named Tobiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, after I had been deported to Nineveh, all
my brothers and relatives ate the food of heathens, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but I refrained from eating that kind of food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because of this wholehearted service of God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the Most High granted me favor and status with
Shalmaneser, so that I became purchasing agent for all his needs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YN href="__PCB.HTM#$YN">5</a></sup></font></sup> Every now and then until his death I would go
to Media to buy goods for him. I also deposited several pouches containing a
great sum of money with my kinsman Gabael, son of Gabri, who lived at Rages, in
Media. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YO href="__PCB.HTM#$YO">6</a></sup></font></sup> But when Shalmaneser died and his son
Sennacherib succeeded him as king, the roads to Media became unsafe, so I could
no longer go there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During Shalmaneser's reign I performed many
charitable works for my kinsmen and my people. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YP href="__PCB.HTM#$YP">7</a></sup></font></sup> I would give my bread to the hungry and my
clothing to the naked. If I saw one of my people who had died and been thrown
outside the walls of Nineveh, I would bury him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I also buried anyone whom Sennacherib slew when
he returned as a fugitive from Judea during the days of judgment decreed
against him by the heavenly King because of the blasphemies he had uttered. In
his rage he killed many Israelites, but I used to take their bodies by stealth
and bury them; so when Sennacherib looked for them, he could not find them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But a certain citizen of Nineveh informed the
king that it was I who buried the dead. When I found out that the king knew all
about me and wanted to put me to death, I went into hiding; then in my fear I
took to flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Afterward, all my property was confiscated; I
was left with nothing. All that I had was taken to the king's palace, except
for my wife Anna and my son Tobiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YQ href="__PCB.HTM#$YQ">8</a></sup></font></sup> But less than forty days later the king was
assassinated by two of his sons, who then escaped into the mountains of Ararat.
His son Esarhaddon, who succeeded him as king, placed Ahiqar, my brother
Anael's son, in charge of all the accounts of his kingdom, so that he took
control over the entire administration. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ahiqar interceded on my behalf, and I was
able to return to Nineveh. For under Sennacherib, king of Assyria, Ahiqar had
been chief cupbearer, keeper of the seal, administrator, and treasurer; and
Esarhaddon reappointed him. He was a close relative-in fact, my nephew. </p>

Inconsistencies such as this point to the fact that the Book of Tobit is a

different forms: Aramaic, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic (Arabian Nights), Greek

Tobit the uncle of the famous Ahiqar in order to enhance Tobit's own prestige.
