<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 22</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Three years passed without war between Aram and
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the third year, however, King Jehoshaphat of
Judah came down to the king of Israel, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who said to his servants, &quot;Do you not know
that Ramoth-gilead is ours and we are doing nothing to take it from the king of
Aram?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He asked Jehoshaphat, &quot;Will you come with
me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?&quot; Jehoshaphat answered the king of
Israel, &quot;You and I are as one, and your people and my people, your horses
and my horses as well.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel,
&quot;Seek the word of the LORD at once.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel gathered together the
prophets, about four hundred of them, and asked, &quot;Shall I go to attack
Ramoth-gilead or shall I refrain?&quot; &quot;Go up,&quot; they answered.
&quot;The LORD will deliver it over to the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jehoshaphat said, &quot;Is there no other
prophet of the LORD here whom we may consult?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel answered, &quot;There is one
other through whom we might consult the LORD, Micaiah, son of Imlah; but I hate
him because he prophesies not good but evil about me.&quot; Jehoshaphat said,
&quot;Let not your majesty speak of evil against you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king of Israel called an official and
said to him, &quot;Get Micaiah, son of Imlah, at once.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of
Judah were seated, each on his throne, clothed in their robes of state on a
threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets
were prophesying before them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns
of iron and said, &quot;The LORD says, 'With these you shall gore Aram until
you have destroyed them.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The other prophets prophesied in a similar
vein, saying: &quot;Go up to Ramoth-gilead; you shall succeed. The LORD will
deliver it over to the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The messenger who had gone to call Micaiah said
to him, &quot;Look now, the prophets are unanimously predicting good for the
king. Let your word be the same as any of theirs; predict good.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;As the LORD lives,&quot; Micaiah
answered, &quot;I shall say whatever the LORD tells me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he came to the king, the king said to him,
&quot;Micaiah, shall we go to fight against Ramoth-gilead, or shall we
refrain?&quot; &quot;Go up,&quot; he answered, &quot;you shall succeed! The
LORD will deliver it over to the king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king answered him, &quot;How many times
must I adjure you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the
LORD?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Micaiah said: &quot;I see all Israel
scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD saying,
'These have no master! Let each of them go back home in peace.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
&quot;Did I not tell you he prophesies not good but evil about me?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SH href="__P90.HTM#$SH">1</a></sup></font></sup> Micaiah continued: &quot;Therefore hear the
word of the LORD: I saw the LORD seated on his throne, with the whole host of
heaven standing by to his right and to his left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD asked, 'Who will deceive Ahab, so that
he will go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said this, another that, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>until one of the spirits came forth and
presented himself to the LORD, saying, 'I will deceive him.' The LORD asked,
'How?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He answered, 'I will go forth and become a
lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' The LORD replied, 'You shall
succeed in deceiving him. Go forth and do this.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So now, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the
mouths of all these prophets of yours, but the LORD himself has decreed evil
against you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, came up
and slapped Micaiah on the cheek, saying, &quot;Has the spirit of the LORD,
then, left me to speak with you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You shall find out,&quot; Micaiah
replied, &quot;on that day when you retreat into an inside room to hide.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel then said, &quot;Seize
Micaiah and take him back to Amon, prefect of the city, and to Joash, the
king's son, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and say, 'This is the king's order: Put this
man in prison and feed him scanty rations of bread and water until I return in
safety.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SI href="__P90.HTM#$SI">2</a></sup></font></sup> But Micaiah said, &quot;If ever you return in
safety, the LORD has not spoken through me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of
Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat,
&quot;I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your own
clothes.&quot; So the king of Israel disguised himself and entered the fray. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the meantime the king of Aram had given his
thirty-two chariot commanders the order, &quot;Do not fight with anyone at all
except the king of Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat,
they cried out, &quot;That must be the king of Israel!&quot; and shifted to
fight him. But Jehoshaphat shouted his battle cry, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the chariot commanders, aware that he was
not the king of Israel, gave up pursuit of him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Someone, however, drew his bow at random, and
hit the king of Israel between the joints of his breastplate. He ordered his
charioteer, &quot;Rein about and take me out of the ranks, for I am
disabled.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The battle grew fierce during the day, and the
king, who was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans, died in the
evening. The blood from his wound flowed to the bottom of the chariot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At sunset a cry went through the army,
&quot;Every man to his city, every man to his land, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for the king is dead!&quot; So they went to
Samaria, where they buried the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the chariot was washed at the pool of
Samaria, the dogs licked up his blood and harlots bathed there, as the LORD had
prophesied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Ahab, with all that he
did, including the ivory palace and all the cities he built, are recorded in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahab rested with his ancestors, and his son
Ahaziah succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat, son of Asa, began to reign over
Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He followed all the ways of his father Asa
unswervingly, doing what was right in the LORD'S sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nevertheless, the high places did not
disappear, and the people continued to sacrifice and to burn incense on the
high places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, with his
prowess, what he did and how he fought, are recorded in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He removed from the land the rest of the cult
prostitutes who had remained in the reign of his father Asa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There was no king in Edom, but an appointed
regent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat made Tarshish ships to go to Ophir
for gold; but in fact the ships did not go, because they were wrecked at
Ezion-geber. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Ahaziah, son of Ahab, said to Jehoshaphat,
&quot;Let my servants accompany your servants in the ships.&quot; But
Jehoshaphat would not agree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors; he was
buried in his forefathers' City of David. His son Jehoram succeeded him as
king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-SJ href="__P90.HTM#$SJ">3</a></sup></font></sup> Ahaziah, son of Ahab, began to reign over
Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; he
reigned two years over Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, behaving
like his father, his mother, and Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to
sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He served and worshiped Baal, thus provoking
the LORD, the God of Israel, just as his father had done. </p>
