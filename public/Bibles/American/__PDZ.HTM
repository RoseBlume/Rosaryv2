<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jonathan saw that the times favored him,
he sent selected men to Rome to confirm and renew his friendship with the
Romans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also sent letters to Sparta and other places
for the same purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After reaching Rome, the men entered the senate
chamber and said, &quot;The high priest Jonathan and the Jewish people have
sent us to renew the earlier friendship and alliance between you and
them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Romans gave them letters addressed to the
authorities in the various places, requesting them to provide the envoys with
safe conduct to the land of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is a copy of the letter that Jonathan
wrote to the Spartans: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Jonathan the high priest, the senate of
the nation, the priests, and the rest of the Jewish people send greetings to
their brothers the Spartans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-13Z href="__PDZ.HTM#$13Z">1</a></sup></font></sup> Long ago a letter was sent to the high priest
Onias from Arius, who then reigned over you, stating that you are our brothers,
as the attached copy shows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Onias welcomed the envoy with honor and
received the letter, which clearly referred to alliance and friendship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-140 href="__PDZ.HTM#$140">2</a></sup></font></sup> Though we have no need of these things, since
we have for our encouragement the sacred books that are in our possession, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>we have ventured to send word to you for the
renewal of brotherhood and friendship, so as not to become strangers to you
altogether; a long time has passed since your mission to us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We, on our part, have never ceased to remember
you in the sacrifices and prayers that we offer on our feasts and other
appropriate days, as it is right and proper to remember brothers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We likewise rejoice in your renown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But many hardships and wars have beset us, and
the kings around us have attacked us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We did not wish to be troublesome to you and to
the rest of our allies and friends in these wars; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>with the help of Heaven for our support, we
have been saved from our enemies, and they have been humbled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So we have chosen Numenius, son of Antiochus,
and Antipater, son of Jason, and we have sent them to the Romans to renew our
former friendship and alliance with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We have also ordered them to come to you and
greet you, and to deliver to you our letter about the renewal of our
brotherhood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore kindly send us an answer on this
matter.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is a copy of the letter that was sent to
Onias: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Arius, king of the Spartans, sends
greetings to Onias the high priest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A document has been found stating that the
Spartans and the Jews are brothers; both nations descended from Abraham. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now that we have learned this, kindly write to
us about your welfare. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We, on our part, are informing you that your
cattle and your possessions are ours, and ours are yours. We have, therefore,
given orders that you should be told of this.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius
had returned to attack him with a stronger army than before. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-141 href="__PDZ.HTM#$141">3</a></sup></font></sup> He set out from Jerusalem and went into the
country of Hamath to meet them, giving them no time to enter his province. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The spies he had sent into their camp came back
and reported that the enemy had made ready to attack the Jews that very night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, when the sun set, Jonathan ordered
his men to be on guard and to remain armed, ready for combat, throughout the
night. He also set outposts all around the camp. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the enemy heard that Jonathan and his men
were ready for battle, their hearts sank with fear and dread. They lighted
fires and then withdrew. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But because Jonathan and his men were watching
the lights burning, they did not know what had happened until morning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jonathan pursued them, but he could not
overtake them, for they had crossed the river Eleutherus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jonathan turned aside against the Arabs who
are called Zabadeans, overwhelming and plundering them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he marched on to Damascus and traversed
that whole region. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Simon also set out and went as far as Ashkalon
and its neighboring strongholds. He then turned to Joppa and occupied it, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for he heard that its men had intended to hand
over this stronghold to the supporters of Demetrius. He left a garrison there
to guard it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jonathan returned, he assembled the elders
of the people, and with them he made plans for building strongholds in Judea, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for making the walls of Jerusalem still higher,
and for erecting a high barrier between the citadel and the city, that would
isolate the citadel and so prevent its garrison from commerce with the city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people therefore worked together on
building up the city, for part of the east wall above the ravine had collapsed.
The quarter called Chaphenatha was also repaired. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Simon likewise built up Adida in the Shephelah,
and strengthened its fortifications by providing them with gates and bars. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Trypho was determined to become king of Asia,
assume the crown, and do away with King Antiochus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he was afraid that Jonathan would not
permit him, but would fight against him. Looking for a way to seize and kill
him, he set out and reached Beth-shan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan marched out against him with forty
thousand picked fighting men and came to Beth-shan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when Trypho saw that Jonathan had arrived
with a large army he was afraid to offer him violence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Instead, he received him with honor, introduced
him to all his friends, and gave him presents. He also ordered his friends and
soldiers to obey him as they would himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to Jonathan: &quot;Why have you
put all your soldiers to so much trouble when we are not at war? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pick out a few men to stay with you, send the
rest back home, and then come with me to Ptolemais. I will hand it over to you
together with other strongholds and their garrisons, as well as the officials,
then I will leave and go home. That is why I came here.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jonathan believed him and did as he said. He
dismissed his troops, and they returned to the land of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he kept with him three thousand men, of
whom he sent two thousand to Galilee while one thousand accompanied him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then as soon as Jonathan had entered Ptolemais,
the men of the city closed the gates and seized him; all who had entered with
him, they killed with the sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-142 href="__PDZ.HTM#$142">4</a></sup></font></sup> Trypho sent soldiers and cavalry to Galilee
and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan's men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These, upon learning that Jonathan had been
captured and his companions killed, encouraged one another and went out in
compact body ready to fight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As their pursuers saw that they were ready to
fight for their lives, they turned back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus all these men of Jonathan came safely into
the land of Judah. They mourned over Jonathan and his men, and were in great
fear, and all Israel fell into deep mourning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the nations round about sought to destroy
them. They said, &quot;Now that they have no leader to help them, let us make
war on them and wipe out their memory from among men.&quot; </p>
