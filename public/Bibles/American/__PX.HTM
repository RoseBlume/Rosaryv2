<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob learned that Laban's sons were saying,
&quot;Jacob has taken everything that belonged to our father, and he has
accumulated all this wealth of his by using our father's property.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob perceived, too, that Laban's attitude
toward him was not what it had previously been. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to Jacob, &quot;Return to
the land of your fathers, where you were born, and I will be with you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to meet him
where he was in the field with his flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There he said to them: &quot;I have noticed
that your father's attitude toward me is not as it was in the past; but the God
of my father has been with me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You well know what effort I put into serving
your father; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>yet your father cheated me and changed my wages
time after time. God, however, did not let him do me any harm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4W href="__PX.HTM#$4W">1</a></sup></font></sup> Whenever your father said, 'The speckled
animals shall be your wages,' the entire flock would bear speckled young;
whenever he said, 'The streaked animals shall be your wages,' the entire flock
would bear streaked young. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus God reclaimed your father's livestock and
gave it to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once, in the breeding season, I had a dream in
which I saw mating he-goats that were streaked, speckled and mottled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the dream God's messenger called to me,
'Jacob!' 'Here!' I replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said: 'Note well. All the he-goats in
the flock, as they mate, are streaked, speckled and mottled, for I have seen
all the things that Laban has been doing to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am the God who appeared to you in Bethel,
where you anointed a memorial stone and made a vow to me. Up, then! Leave this
land and return to the land of your birth.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rachel and Leah answered him: &quot;Have we
still an heir's portion in our father's house? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4X href="__PX.HTM#$4X">2</a></sup></font></sup> Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? He
not only sold us; he has even used up the money that he got for us! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the wealth that God reclaimed from our
father really belongs to us and our children. Therefore, do just as God has
told you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob proceeded to put his children and wives
on camels, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he drove off with all his livestock and all
the property he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the
land of Canaan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4Y href="__PX.HTM#$4Y">3</a></sup></font></sup> Now Laban had gone away to shear his sheep,
and Rachel had meanwhile appropriated her father's household idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-4Z href="__PX.HTM#$4Z">4</a></sup></font></sup> Jacob had hoodwinked Laban the Aramean by not
telling him of his intended flight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus he made his escape with all that he had.
Once he was across the Euphrates, he headed for the highlands of Gilead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the third day, word came to Laban that Jacob
had fled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-50 href="__PX.HTM#$50">5</a></sup></font></sup> Taking his kinsmen with him, he pursued him
for seven days until he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But that night God appeared to Laban the
Aramean in a dream and warned him, &quot;Take care not to threaten Jacob with
any harm!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Laban overtook Jacob, Jacob's tents were
pitched in the highlands; Laban also pitched his tents there, on Mount Gilead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-51 href="__PX.HTM#$51">6</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;What do you mean,&quot; Laban demanded
of Jacob, &quot;by hoodwinking me and carrying off my daughters like war
captives? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why did you dupe me by stealing away secretly?
You should have told me, and I would have sent you off with merry singing to
the sound of tambourines and harps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You did not even allow me a parting kiss to my
daughters and grandchildren! What you have now done is a senseless thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have it in my power to harm all of you; but
last night the God of your father said to me, 'Take care not to threaten Jacob
with any harm!' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Granted that you had to leave because you were desperately
homesick for your father's house, why did you steal my gods?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I was frightened,&quot; Jacob replied to
Laban, &quot;at the thought that you might take your daughters away from me by
force. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But as for your gods, the one you find them
with shall not remain alive! If, with my kinsmen looking on, you identify
anything here as belonging to you, take it.&quot; Jacob, of course, had no idea
that Rachel had stolen the idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Laban then went in and searched Jacob's tent
and Leah's tent, as well as the tents of the two maidservants; but he did not
find the idols. Leaving Leah's tent, he went into Rachel's. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Rachel had taken the idols, put them inside
a camel cushion, and seated herself upon them. When Laban had rummaged through
the rest of her tent without finding them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rachel said to her father, &quot;Let not my
lord feel offended that I cannot rise in your presence; a woman's period is
upon me.&quot; So, despite his search, he did not find his idols. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob, now enraged, upbraided Laban. &quot;What
crime or offense have I committed,&quot; he demanded, &quot;that you should
hound me so fiercely? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now that you have ransacked all my things, have
you found a single object taken from your belongings? If so, produce it here
before your kinsmen and mine, and let them decide between us two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;In the twenty years that I was under you,
no ewe or she-goat of yours ever miscarried, and I have never feasted on a ram
of your flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-52 href="__PX.HTM#$52">7</a></sup></font></sup> I never brought you an animal torn by wild
beasts; I made good the loss myself. You held me responsible for anything
stolen by day or night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How often the scorching heat ravaged me by day,
and the frost by night, while sleep fled from my eyes! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Of the twenty years that I have now spent in
your household, I slaved fourteen years for your two daughters and six years
for your flock, while you changed my wages time after time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If my ancestral God, the God of Abraham and the
Awesome One of Isaac, had not been on my side, you would now have sent me away
empty-handed. But God saw my plight and the fruits of my toil, and last night
he gave judgment.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-53 href="__PX.HTM#$53">8</a></sup></font></sup> Laban replied to Jacob: &quot;The women are
mine, their children are mine, and the flocks are mine; everything you see
belongs to me. But since these women are my daughters, I will now do something
for them and for the children they have borne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Come, then, we will make a pact, you and I; the
LORD shall be a witness between us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jacob took a stone and set it up as a
memorial stone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob said to his kinsmen, &quot;Gather some
stones.&quot; So they got some stones and made a mound; and they had a meal
there at the mound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-54 href="__PX.HTM#$54">9</a></sup></font></sup> Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob
named it Galeed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;This mound,&quot; said Laban, &quot;shall
be a witness from now on between you and me.&quot; That is why it was named
Galeed -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-55 href="__PX.HTM#$55">10</a></sup></font></sup> and also Mizpah, for he said: &quot;May the
LORD keep watch between you and me when we are out of each other's sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you mistreat my daughters, or take other
wives besides my daughters, remember that even though no one else is about, God
will be witness between you and me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Laban said further to Jacob: &quot;Here is this
mound, and here is the memorial stone that I have set up between you and me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This mound shall be witness, and this memorial
stone shall be witness, that, with hostile intent, neither may I pass beyond
this mound into your territory, nor may you pass beyond it into mine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor
(their ancestral deities) maintain justice between us!&quot; Jacob took the
oath by the Awesome One of Isaac. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then offered a sacrifice on the mountain and
invited his kinsmen to share in the meal. When they had eaten, they passed the
night on the mountain. </p>
