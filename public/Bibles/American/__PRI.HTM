<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2II href="__PRI.HTM#$2II">1</a></sup></font></sup> On the fifth day of the sixth month, in the
sixth year, as I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before
me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2IJ href="__PRI.HTM#$2IJ">2</a></sup></font></sup> I looked up and saw a form that looked like a
man. Downward from what seemed to be his waist, there was fire; from his waist
upward there seemed to be a brightness like the sheen of electrum. He stretched
out what appeared to be a hand and seized me by the hair of my head. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I saw there the glory of the God of Israel,
like the vision I had seen in the plain. The cherubim were stationed to the
right of the temple; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>these were the living creatures I had seen
beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar, whom I now recognized to be
cherubim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each ohad four faces and four wings; something
like human hands were under their wings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their faces looked just like those I had seen
by the river Chebar; each one went straight forward. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each had four faces: the first face was that of
an ox, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that
of an eagle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Such were the living creatures I had seen by
the river Chebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I also saw four wheels beside them, one wheel
beside each cherub; the wheels appeared to have the luster of chrysolite stone.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All four of them seemed to be made the same, as
though they were a wheel within a wheel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they moved, they went in any one of their
four directions without veering as they moved; for in whichever direction they
were faced, they went straight toward it without veering as they moved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rims of the four wheels were full of eyes
all around. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I heard the wheels given the name
&quot;wheelwork.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the cherubim moved, the wheels went beside
them; when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise from the earth, even then
the wheels did not leave their sides. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they stood still, the wheels stood still;
when they rose, the wheels rose with them; for the living creatures' spirit was
in them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I looked and saw in the firmament above the cherubim
what appeared to be sapphire stone; something like a throne could be seen upon
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2IK href="__PRI.HTM#$2IK">3</a></sup></font></sup> He said to the man dressed in linen: Go within
the wheelwork under the cherubim; fill both your hands with burning coals from
among the cherubim, then scatter them over the city. As I looked on, he
entered. The glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherubim, upon
which it had been, to the threshold of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As the man entered, the cloud filled the inner
court, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the glory of the LORD rose from over the
cherubim to the threshold of the temple; the temple was filled with the cloud,
and all the court was bright with the glory of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The noise of the wings of the cherubim could be
heard as far as the outer court; it was like the voice of God the Almighty when
he speaks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he had commanded the man dressed in linen
to take fire from within the wheelwork, among the cherubim, the man entered and
stood by one of the wheels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon its cherub stretched out his hand
toward the fire that was among the cherubim. He took up some of it and put it
in the hands of the one dressed in linen, who took it and came out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(Something like human hands could be seen under
the wings of the cherubim.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the glory of the LORD left the threshold
of the temple and rested upon the cherubim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These lifted their wings, and I saw them rise
from the earth, the wheels rising along with them. They stood at the entrance
of the eastern gate of the LORD'S house, and the glory of the God of Israel was
up above them. </p>
