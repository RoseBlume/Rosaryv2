<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 3</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With the royal power firmly in his grasp,
Solomon allied himself by marriage with Pharaoh, king of Egypt. The daughter of
Pharaoh, whom he married, he brought to the City of David, until he should
finish building his palace, and the temple of the LORD, and the wall around
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, the people were sacrificing on the high
places, for up to that time no temple had been built to the name of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon loved the LORD, and obeyed the statutes
of his father David; yet he offered sacrifice and burned incense on the high
places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there,
because that was the most renowned high place. Upon its altar Solomon offered a
thousand holocausts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a
dream at night. God said, &quot;Ask something of me and I will give it to
you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon answered: &quot;You have shown great
favor to your servant, my father David, because he behaved faithfully toward
you, with justice and an upright heart; and you have continued this great favor
toward him, even today, seating a son of his on his throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>O LORD, my God, you have made me, your servant,
king to succeed my father David; but I am a mere youth, not knowing at all how
to act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I serve you in the midst of the people whom you
have chosen, a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give your servant, therefore, an understanding
heart to judge your people and to distinguish right from wrong. For who is able
to govern this vast people of yours?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD was pleased that Solomon made this
request. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So God said to him: &quot;Because you have
asked for this - not for a long life for yourself, nor for riches, nor for the
life of your enemies, but for understanding so that you may know what is right
-&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I do as you requested. I give you a heart so
wise and understanding that there has never been anyone like you up to now, and
after you there will come no one to equal you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In addition, I give you what you have not asked
for, such riches and glory that among kings there is not your like. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And if you follow me by keeping my statutes and
commandments, as your father David did, I will give you a long life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Solomon awoke from his dream, he went to
Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, offered holocausts
and peace offerings, and gave a banquet for all his servants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Later, two harlots came to the king and stood
before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One woman said: &quot;By your leave, my lord,
this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth in the house while
she was present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the third day after I gave birth, this woman
also gave birth. We were alone in the house; there was no one there but us two.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This woman's son died during the night; she
smothered him by lying on him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Later that night she got up and took my son
from my side, as I, your handmaid, was sleeping. Then she laid him in her
bosom, after she had laid her dead child in my bosom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I rose in the morning to nurse my child, and I
found him dead. But when I examined him in the morning light, I saw it was not
the son whom I had borne.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The other woman answered, &quot;It is not so!
The living one is my son, the dead one is yours.&quot; But the first kept
saying, &quot;No, the dead one is your child, the living one is mine!&quot;
Thus they argued before the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said: &quot;One woman claims,
'This, the living one, is my child, and the dead one is yours.' The other
answers, 'No! The dead one is your child; the living one is mine.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king continued, &quot;Get me a sword.&quot;
When they brought the sword before him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he said, &quot;Cut the living child in two, and
give half to one woman and half to the other.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The woman whose son it was, in the anguish she
felt for it, said to the king, &quot;Please, my lord, give her the living child
- please do not kill it!&quot; The other, however, said, &quot;It shall be
neither mine nor yours. Divide it!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then answered, &quot;Give the first
one the living child! By no means kill it, for she is the mother.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all Israel heard the judgment the king had
given, they were in awe of him, because they saw that the king had in him the
wisdom of God for giving judgment. </p>
