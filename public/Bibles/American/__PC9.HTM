<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YF href="__PC9.HTM#$YF">1</a></sup></font></sup> At that time, when there was reading from the
book of Moses in the hearing of the people, it was found written there that
&quot;no Ammonite or Moabite may ever be admitted into the assembly of God; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for they would not succor the Israelites with
food and water, but they hired Balaam to curse them, though our God turned the
curse into a blessing.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had heard the law, they separated
from Israel every foreign element. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YG href="__PC9.HTM#$YG">2</a></sup></font></sup> Before this, the priest Eliashib, who had been
placed in charge of the chambers of the house of our God and who was an
associate of Tobiah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>had set aside for the latter's use a large
chamber in which had previously been stored the cereal offerings, incense and
utensils, the tithes in grain, wine, and oil allotted to the Levites, singers,
and gatekeepers, and the offerings due the priests. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YH href="__PC9.HTM#$YH">3</a></sup></font></sup> During all this time I had not been in Jerusalem,
for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I had gone back
to the king. After due time, however, I asked leave of the king </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and returned to Jerusalem, where I discovered
the evil thing that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in setting aside for him a
chamber in the courts of the house of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This displeased me very much, and I had all of
Tobiah's household goods thrown outside the chamber. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I gave orders to purify the chambers, and
I had them replace there the utensils of the house of God, the cereal
offerings, and the incense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I learned, too, that the portions due the
Levites were no longer being given, so that the Levites and the singers who
should have been carrying out the services had deserted, each man to his own
field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I took the magistrates to task, demanding,
&quot;Why is the house of God abandoned?&quot; Then I brought the Levites
together and had them resume their stations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All Judah once more brought in the tithes of
grain, wine, and oil to the storerooms; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and in charge of the storerooms I appointed the
priest Shelemiah, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah, one of the Levites, together
with Hanan, son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, as their assistant; for these men
were held to be trustworthy. It was their duty to make the distribution to
their brethren. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Remember this to my credit, O my God! Let not
the devotion which I showed for the house of my God and its services be
forgotten! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In those days I perceived that men in Judah
were treading the winepresses on the sabbath; that they were bringing in
sheaves of grain, loading them on their asses, together with wine, grapes,
figs, and every other kind of burden, and bringing them to Jerusalem on the
sabbath day. I warned them to sell none of these victuals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In Jerusalem itself the Tyrians who were
resident there were importing fish and every other kind of merchandise and
selling it to the Judahites on the sabbath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I took the nobles of Judah to task, demanding
of them: &quot;What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the
sabbath day? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Did not your fathers act in this same way, with
the result that our God has brought all this evil upon us and upon this city?
Would you add to the wrath against Israel by once more profaning the
sabbath?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the shadows were falling on the gates of
Jerusalem before the sabbath, I ordered the doors to be closed and forbade them
to be reopened till after the sabbath. I posted some of my own men at the gates
so that no burden might enter on the sabbath day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The merchants and sellers of various kinds of
merchandise spent the night once or twice outside Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but then I warned them, saying to them:
&quot;Why do you spend the night alongside the wall? If you keep this up, I
will lay hands on you!&quot; From that time on, they did not return on the
sabbath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I ordered the Levites to purify themselves
and to go and watch the gates, so that the sabbath day might be kept holy.
This, too, remember in my favor, O my God, and have mercy on me in accordance
with your great mercy! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Also in those days I saw Jews who had married
Ashdodite, Ammonite, or Moabite wives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-YI href="__PC9.HTM#$YI">4</a></sup></font></sup> Of their children, half spoke Ashdodite, and
none of them knew how to speak Jewish; and so it was in regard to the languages
of the various other peoples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I took them to task and cursed them; I had some
of them beaten and their hair pulled out; and I adjured them by God: &quot;You
shall not marry your daughters to their sons nor take any of their daughters
for your sons or for yourselves! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Did not Solomon, the king of Israel, sin
because of them? Though among the many nations there was no king like him, and
though he was beloved of his God and God had made him king over all Israel, yet
even he was made to sin by foreign women. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Must it also be heard of you that you have done
this same very great evil, betraying our God by marrying foreign women?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the
high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite! I drove him from my
presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Remember against them, O my God, how they
defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus I cleansed them of all foreign
contamination. I established the various functions for the priests and Levites,
so that each had his appointed task. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I also provided for the procurement of wood at
stated times and for the first fruits. Remember this in my favor, O my God! </p>
