<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel addressed all Israel: &quot;I have
granted your request in every respect,&quot; he said. &quot;I have set a king
over you </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and now the king is your leader. As for me, I
am old and gray, and have sons among you. I have lived with you from my youth
to the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Here I stand! Answer me in the presence of the
LORD and of his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose ass have I taken? Whom
have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whom have I accepted a bribe and
overlooked his guilt? I will make restitution to you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They replied, &quot;You have neither cheated
us, nor oppressed us, nor accepted anything from anyone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said to them, &quot;The LORD is witness against
you this day, and his anointed as well, that you have found nothing in my
possession.&quot; &quot;He is witness,&quot; they agreed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Continuing, Samuel said to the people:
&quot;The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your
fathers up from the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, therefore, take your stand, and I shall
arraign you before the LORD, and shall recount for you all the acts of mercy
the LORD has done for you and your fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jacob and his sons went to Egypt and the
Egyptians oppressed them, your fathers appealed to the LORD, who sent Moses and
Aaron to bring them out of Egypt, and he gave them this place to live in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they forgot the LORD their God; and he
allowed them to fall into the clutches of Sisera, the captain of the army of
Jabin, king of Hazor, into the grasp of the Philistines, and into the grip of
the king of Moab, who made war against them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each time they appealed to the LORD and said,
'We have sinned in forsaking the LORD and worshiping Baals and Ashtaroth; but
deliver us now from the power of our enemies, and we will worship you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Accordingly, the LORD sent Jerubbaal, Barak,
Jephthah, and Samuel; he delivered you from the power of your enemies on every
side, so that you were able to live in security. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet, when you saw Nahash, king of the
Ammonites, advancing against you, you said to me, 'Not so, but a king must rule
us,' even though the LORD your God is your king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Now you have the king you want, a king
the LORD has given you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you fear the LORD and worship him, if you
are obedient to him and do not rebel against the LORD'S command, if both you
and the king who rules you follow the LORD your God - well and good. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you do not obey the LORD and if you
rebel against his command, the LORD will deal severely with you and your king,
and destroy you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now then, stand ready to witness the great
marvel the LORD is about to accomplish before your eyes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Are we not in the harvest time for wheat? Yet I
shall call to the LORD, and he will send thunder and rain. Thus you will see
and understand how greatly the LORD is displeased that you have asked for a
king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel then called to the LORD, and the LORD
sent thunder and rain that day. As a result, all the people dreaded the LORD
and Samuel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They said to Samuel, &quot;Pray to the LORD
your God for us, your servants, that we may not die for having added to all our
other sins the evil of asking for a king.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Do not fear,&quot; Samuel answered them.
&quot;It is true you have committed all this evil; still, you must not turn
from the LORD, but must worship him with your whole heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not turn to meaningless idols which can
neither profit nor save; they are nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the sake of his own great name the LORD
will not abandon his people, since the LORD himself chose to make you his
people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for me, far be it from me to sin against the
LORD by ceasing to pray for you and to teach you the good and right way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you must fear the LORD and worship him
faithfully with your whole heart; keep in mind the great things he has done
among you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If instead you continue to do evil, both you
and your king shall perish.&quot; </p>
