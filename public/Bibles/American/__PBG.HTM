<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 32</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But after he had proved his fidelity by such
deeds, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came. He invaded Judah, besieged the
fortified cities, and proposed to take them by storm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was coming
with the intention of attacking Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he decided in counsel with his princes and
warriors to stop the waters of the springs outside the city. When they had
pledged him their support, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a large crowd was gathered which stopped all
the springs and also the running stream in the valley nearby. For they said,
&quot;Why should the kings of Assyria come and find an abundance of
water?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then looked to his defenses: he rebuilt the
wall where it was broken down, raised towers upon it, and built another wall
outside. He strengthened the Millo of the City of David and had a great number
of spears and shields prepared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he appointed army commanders over the
people. He gathered them together in his presence in the open space at the gate
of the city and encouraged them with these words: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Be brave and steadfast; do not be afraid
or dismayed because of the king of Assyria and all the throng that is coming
with him, for there is more with us than with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For he has only an arm of flesh, but we have
the LORD, our God, to help us and to fight our battles.&quot; And the people
took confidence from the words of King Hezekiah of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After this, while Sennacherib, king of Assyria,
himself remained at Lachish with all his forces, he sent his officials to
Jerusalem with this message for King Hezekiah of Judah, and all the Judahites
who were in Jerusalem: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;King Sennacherib of Assyria has this to
say: On what are you relying, while you remain under siege in Jerusalem? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Has not Hezekiah deceived you, delivering you
over to a death of famine and thirst, by his claim that 'the LORD, our God,
will save us from the grasp of the king of Assyria'? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Has not this same Hezekiah removed his high
places and altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, 'You shall prostrate
yourselves before one altar only, and on it alone you shall offer incense'? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do you not know what my fathers and I have done
to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations in those lands
able to save their lands from my hand? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Who among all the gods of those nations which
my fathers put under the ban was able to save his people from my hand? Will
your god, then, be able to save you from my hand? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let not Hezekiah mislead you further and
deceive you in any such way. Do not believe him! Since no other god of any
other nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand or the
hands of my fathers, how much the less shall your god save you from my
hand!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His officials said still more against the LORD
God and against his servant Hezekiah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for he had written letters to deride the LORD,
the God of Israel, speaking of him in these terms: &quot;As the gods of the
nations in other lands have not saved their people from my hand, neither shall
Hezekiah's god save his people from my hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In a loud voice they shouted in the Judean
language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and
terrify them so that they might capture their city. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They spoke of the God of Israel as though he
were one of the gods of the other peoples of the earth, a work of human hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But because of this, King Hezekiah and the
prophet Isaiah, son of Amos, prayed and called out to heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD sent an angel, who destroyed
every valiant warrior, leader and commander in the camp of the Assyrian king,
so that he had to return shamefaced to his own country. And when he entered the
temple of his god, some of his own offspring struck him down there with the
sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, as from
every other power; he gave them rest on every side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Many brought gifts for the LORD to Jerusalem
and costly objects for King Hezekiah of Judah, who thereafter was exalted in
the eyes of all the nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. He
prayed to the LORD, who answered him by giving him a sign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah, however, did not then discharge his
debt of gratitude, for he had become proud. Therefore anger descended upon him
and upon Judah and Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But then Hezekiah humbled himself for his pride
- both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and therefore the LORD did not vent
his anger on them during the time of Hezekiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hezekiah possessed very great wealth and glory.
He had treasuries made for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, jewels,
and other precious things of all kinds; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>also storehouses for the harvest of grain, for
wine and oil, and barns for the various kinds of cattle and for the flocks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He built cities for himself, and he acquired
sheep and oxen in great numbers, for God gave him very great riches. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This same Hezekiah stopped the upper outflow of
water from Gihon and led it underground westward to the City of David. Hezekiah
prospered in all his undertakings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nevertheless, in respect to the ambassadors
(princes) sent to him from Babylon to investigate the sign that had occurred in
the land, God forsook him to test him, that he might know all that was in his
heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of Hezekiah's acts, including his
pious works, can be found written in the Vision of the Prophet Isaiah, son of
Amos, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-X1 href="__PBG.HTM#$X1">1</a></sup></font></sup> Hezekiah rested with his ancestors; he was
buried at the approach to the tombs of the descendants of David. All Judah and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. His son Manasseh
succeeded him as king. </p>
