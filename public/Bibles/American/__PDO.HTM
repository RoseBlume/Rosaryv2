<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He fought many campaigns, captured fortresses,
and put kings to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He advanced to the ends of the earth, gathering
plunder from many nations; the earth fell silent before him, and his heart
became proud and arrogant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He collected a very strong army and conquered
provinces, nations, and rulers, and they became his tributaries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5

realizing that he was going to die. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6

his own territory, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9

them, many evils have come upon us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the offering table, the cups and the bowls, the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and took away the gold and silver and the
precious vessels; he also took all the hidden treasures he could find. </p>

fled away, and she became the abode of strangers. She became a stranger to her
