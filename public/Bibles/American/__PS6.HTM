<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 34</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KM href="__PS6.HTM#$2KM">1</a></sup></font></sup> Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of
Israel, in these words prophesy to them (to the shepherds): Thus says the Lord
GOD: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been pasturing themselves! Should
not shepherds, rather, pasture sheep? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You have fed off their milk, worn their wool,
and slaughtered the fatlings, but the sheep you have not pastured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You did not strengthen the weak nor heal the
sick nor bind up the injured. You did not bring back the strayed nor seek the
lost, but you lorded it over them harshly and brutally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they were scattered for lack of a shepherd,
and became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and wandered over all the mountains and high
hills; my sheep were scattered over the whole earth, with no one to look after
them or to search for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the
LORD: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep
have been given over to pillage, and because my sheep have become food for
every wild beast, for lack of a shepherd; because my shepherds did not look
after my sheep, but pastured themselves and did not pasture my sheep; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>because of this, shepherds, hear the word of
the LORD: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: I swear I am coming
against these shepherds. I will claim my sheep from them and put a stop to
their shepherding my sheep so that they may no longer pasture themselves. I
will save my sheep, that they may no longer be food for their mouths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will look
after and tend my sheep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As a shepherd tends his flock when he finds
himself among his scattered sheep, so will I tend my sheep. I will rescue them
from every place where they were scattered when it was cloudy and dark. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will lead them out from among the peoples and
gather them from the foreign lands; I will bring them back to their own country
and pasture them upon the mountains of Israel (in the land's ravines and all
its inhabited places). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In good pastures will I pasture them, and on
the mountain heights of Israel shall be their grazing ground. There they shall
lie down on good grazing ground, and in rich pastures shall they be pastured on
the mountains of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I myself will pasture my sheep; I myself will
give them rest, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The lost I will seek out, the strayed I will
bring back, the injured I will bind up, the sick I will heal (but the sleek and
the strong I will destroy), shepherding them rightly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, my sheep, says the Lord GOD, I will
judge between one sheep and another, between rams and goats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was it not enough for you to graze on the best
pasture, that you had to trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? Was
it not enough for you to drink the clearest water, that you had to foul the
remainder with your feet? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus my sheep had to graze on what your feet
had trampled and drink what your feet had fouled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now will I
judge between the fat and the lean sheep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because you push with side and shoulder, and
butt all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them out, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will save my sheep so that they may no longer
be despoiled, and I will judge between one sheep and another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KN href="__PS6.HTM#$2KN">2</a></sup></font></sup> I will appoint one shepherd over them to
pasture them, my servant David; he shall pasture them and be their shepherd. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant
David shall be prince among them. I, the LORD, have spoken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will make a covenant of peace with them, and
rid the country of ravenous beasts, that they may dwell securely in the desert
and sleep in the forests. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will place them about my hill, sending rain
in due season, rains that shall be a blessing to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The trees of the field shall bear their fruits,
and the land its crops, and they shall dwell securely on their own soil. Thus
they shall know that I am the LORD when I break the bonds of their yoke and
free them from the power of those who enslaved them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall no longer be despoiled by the
nations or devoured by beasts of the earth, but shall dwell secure, with no one
to frighten them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will prepare for them peaceful fields for
planting; they shall no longer be carried off by famine in the land, or bear
the reproaches of the nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus they shall know that I, the LORD, am their
God, and they are my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(You, my sheep, you are the sheep of my
pasture, and I am your God, says the Lord GOD.) </p>
