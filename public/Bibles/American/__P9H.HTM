<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 17</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea,
son of Elah, began his nine-year reign over Israel in Samaria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He did evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not
to the extent of the kings of Israel before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TU href="__P9H.HTM#$TU">1</a></sup></font></sup> Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, advanced against
him, and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king of Assyria found Hoshea guilty of
conspiracy for sending envoys to the king of Egypt at Sais, and for failure to
pay the annual tribute to his Assyrian overlord. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For this, the king of Assyria arrested and
imprisoned Hoshea; he then occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which
he besieged for three years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TV href="__P9H.HTM#$TV">2</a></sup></font></sup> In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of
Assyria took Samaria, and deported the Israelites to Assyria, settling them in
Halah, at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This came about because the Israelites sinned
against the LORD, their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt,
from under the domination of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and because they venerated
other gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They followed the rites of the nations whom the
LORD had cleared out of the way of the Israelites (and the kings of Israel whom
they set up). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They adopted unlawful practices toward the
LORD, their God. They built high places in all their settlements, the
watchtowers as well as the walled cities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They set up pillars and sacred poles for
themselves on every high hill and under every leafy tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There, on all the high places, they burned
incense like the nations whom the LORD had sent into exile at their coming.
They did evil things that provoked the LORD, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and served idols, although the LORD had told
them, &quot;You must not do this.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And though the LORD warned Israel and Judah by
every prophet and seer, &quot;Give up your evil ways and keep my commandments
and statutes, in accordance with the entire law which I enjoined on your
fathers and which I sent you by my servants the prophets,&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they did not listen, but were as stiff-necked
as their fathers, who had not believed in the LORD, their God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They rejected his statutes, the covenant which
he had made with their fathers, and the warnings which he had given them. The
vanity they pursued, they themselves became: they followed the surrounding nations
whom the LORD had commanded them not to imitate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They disregarded all the commandments of the
LORD, their God, and made for themselves two molten calves; they also made a
sacred pole and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They immolated their sons and daughters by
fire, practiced fortune-telling and divination, and sold themselves into evil
doing in the LORD'S sight, provoking him </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>till, in his great anger against Israel, the
LORD put them away out of his sight. Only the tribe of Judah was left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even the people of Judah, however, did not keep
the commandments of the LORD, their God, but followed the rites practiced by
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the LORD rejected the whole race of Israel.
He afflicted them and delivered them over to plunderers, finally casting them
out from before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he tore Israel away from the house of
David, they made Jeroboam, son of Nebat, king; he drove the Israelites away
from the LORD, causing them to commit a great sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites imitated Jeroboam in all the
sins he committed, nor would they desist from them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally, the LORD put Israel away out of his
sight as he had foretold through all his servants, the prophets; and Israel
went into exile from their native soil to Assyria, an exile lasting to the
present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Assyria brought people from
Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities
of Samaria in place of the Israelites. They took possession of Samaria and
dwelt in its cities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they first settled there, they did not
venerate the LORD, so he sent lions among them that killed some of their
number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A report reached the king of Assyria: &quot;The
nations whom you deported and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know how
to worship the God of the land, and he has sent lions among them that are
killing them, since they do not know how to worship the God of the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king of Assyria gave the order, &quot;Send
back one of the priests whom I deported, to go there and settle, to teach them
how to worship the God of the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So one of the priests who had been deported
from Samaria returned and settled in Bethel, and taught them how to venerate
the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But these peoples began to make their own gods
in the various cities in which they were living; in the shrines on the high
places which the Samarians had made, each people set up gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the Babylonians made Marduk and his
consort; the men of Cuth made Nergal; the men of Hamath made Ashima; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the men of Avva made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the
men of Sepharvaim immolated their children by fire to their city gods, King
Hadad and his consort Anath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They also venerated the LORD, choosing from
their number priests for the high places, who officiated for them in the
shrines on the high places. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But, while venerating the LORD, they served
their own gods, following the worship of the nations from among whom they had
been deported. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-TW href="__P9H.HTM#$TW">3</a></sup></font></sup> To this day they worship according to their
ancient rites. (They did not venerate the LORD nor observe the statutes and
regulations, the law and commandments, which the LORD enjoined on the
descendants of Jacob, whom he had named Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he made a covenant with them, he commanded
them: &quot;You must not venerate other gods, nor worship them, nor serve them,
nor offer sacrifice to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD, who brought you up from the land of Egypt
with great power and outstretched arm: him shall you venerate, him shall you
worship, and to him shall you sacrifice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You must be careful to observe forever the
statutes and regulations, the law and commandment, which he wrote for you, and
you must not venerate other gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The covenant which I made with you, you must
not forget; you must not venerate other gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the LORD, your God, you must venerate; it
is he who will deliver you from the power of all your enemies.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They did not listen, however, but continued in
their earlier manner.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus these nations venerated the LORD, but also
served their idols. And their sons and grandsons, to this day, are doing as
their fathers did. </p>
