<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Israelites violated the ban; Achan, son
of Carmi, son of Zerah, son of Zara of the tribe of Judah, took goods that were
under the ban, and the anger of the LORD flared up against the Israelites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua next sent men from Jericho to Ai, which
is near Bethel on its eastern side, with instructions to go up and reconnoiter
the land. When they had explored Ai, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>they returned to Joshua and advised, &quot;Do
not send all the people up; if only about two or three thousand go up, they can
overcome Ai. The enemy there are few; you need not call for an effort from all
the people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>About three thousand of the people made the
attack, but they were defeated by those at Ai, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>who killed some thirty-six of them. They
pressed them back across the clearing in front of the city gate till they broke
ranks, and defeated them finally on the descent, so that the confidence of the
people melted away like water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua, together with the elders of Israel,
rent his garments and lay prostrate before the ark of the LORD until evening;
and they threw dust on their heads. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Alas, O Lord GOD,&quot; Joshua prayed,
&quot;why did you ever allow this people to pass over the Jordan, delivering us
into the power of the Amorites, that they might destroy us? Would that we had
been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pray, Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has
turned its back to its enemies? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Canaanites and the other inhabitants
of the land hear of it, they will close in around us and efface our name from
the earth. What will you do for your great name?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD replied to Joshua: &quot;Stand up. Why
are you lying prostrate? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel has sinned: they have violated the
covenant which I enjoined on them. They have stealthily taken goods subject to
the ban, and have deceitfully put them in their baggage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If the Israelites cannot stand up to their
enemies, but must turn their back to them, it is because they are under the
ban. I will not remain with you unless you remove from among you whoever has
incurred the ban. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rise, sanctify the people. Tell them to
sanctify themselves before tomorrow, for the LORD, the God of Israel, says: You
are under the ban, O Israel. You cannot stand up to your enemies until you
remove from among you whoever has incurred the ban. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the morning you must present yourselves by
tribes. The tribe which the LORD designates shall come forward by clans; the
clan which the LORD designates shall come forward by families; the family which
the LORD designates shall come forward one by one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He who is designated as having incurred the ban
shall be destroyed by fire, with all that is his, because he has violated the
covenant of the LORD and has committed a shameful crime in Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L0 href="__P5L.HTM#$L0">1</a></sup></font></sup> Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come
forward by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was designated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he had the clans of Judah come forward,
and the clan of Zerah was designated. He had the clan of Zerah come forward by
families, and Zabdi was designated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Finally he had that family come forward one by
one, and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah of the tribe of Judah,
was designated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua said to Achan, &quot;My son, give to the
LORD, the God of Israel, glory and honor by telling me what you have done; do
not hide it from me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Achan answered Joshua, &quot;I have indeed
sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Among the spoils, I saw a beautiful Babylonian
mantle, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold fifty shekels in
weight; in my greed I took them. They are now hidden in the ground inside my
tent, with the silver underneath.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The messengers whom Joshua sent hastened to the
tent and found them hidden there, with the silver underneath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They took them from the tent, brought them to
Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joshua and all Israel took Achan, son of
Zerah, with the silver, the mantle, and the bar of gold, and with his sons and
daughters, his ox, his ass and his sheep, his tent, and all his possessions,
and led them off to the Valley of Achor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joshua said, &quot;The LORD bring upon you
today the misery with which you have afflicted us!&quot; And all Israel stoned
him to death </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-L1 href="__P5L.HTM#$L1">2</a></sup></font></sup> and piled a great heap of stones over him,
which remains to the present day. Then the anger of the LORD relented. That is
why the place is called the Valley of Achor to this day. </p>
