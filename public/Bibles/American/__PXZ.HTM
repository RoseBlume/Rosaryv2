</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40J href="__PXZ.HTM#$40J">1</a></sup></font></sup> A man named Ananias, however, with his wife
Sapphira, sold a piece of property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He retained for himself, with his wife's
knowledge, some of the purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the
feet of the apostles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Peter said, &quot;Ananias, why has Satan
filled your heart so that you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the
price of the land? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>While it remained unsold, did it not remain
yours? And when it was sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you
contrive this deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Ananias heard these words, he fell down
and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The young men came and wrapped him up, then
carried him out and buried him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After an interval of about three hours, his
wife came in, unaware of what had happened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Peter said to her, &quot;Tell me, did you sell
the land for this amount?&quot; She answered, &quot;Yes, for that amount.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Peter said to her, &quot;Why did you agree
to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried
your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed
her last. When the young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her
out and buried her beside her husband. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And great fear came upon the whole church and
upon all who heard of these things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40K href="__PXZ.HTM#$40K">2</a></sup></font></sup> Many signs and wonders were done among the
people at the hands of the apostles. They were all together in Solomon's
portico. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>None of the others dared to join them, but the
people esteemed them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet more than ever, believers in the Lord,
great numbers of men and women, were added to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus they even carried the sick out into the
streets and laid them on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his
shadow might fall on one or another of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>A large number of people from the towns in the
vicinity of Jerusalem also gathered, bringing the sick and those disturbed by
unclean spirits, and they were all cured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40L href="__PXZ.HTM#$40L">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then the high priest rose up and all his
companions, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and, filled with jealousy, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>laid hands upon the apostles and put them in
the public jail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But during the night, the angel of the Lord
opened the doors of the prison, led them out, and said, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go and take your place in the temple
area, and tell the people everything about this life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this, they went to the temple
early in the morning and taught. When the high priest and his companions
arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin, the full senate of the Israelites, and
sent to the jail to have them brought in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the court officers who went did not find
them in the prison, so they came back and reported, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We found the jail securely locked and the
guards stationed outside the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one
inside.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this report, the captain of the
temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss about them, as to what this
would come to. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then someone came in and reported to them,
&quot;The men whom you put in prison are in the temple area and are teaching
the people.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the captain and the court officers went
and brought them in, but without force, because they were afraid of being
stoned by the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they had brought them in and made them
stand before the Sanhedrin, the high priest questioned them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;We gave you strict orders (did we not?)
to stop teaching in that name. Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching
and want to bring this man's blood upon us.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Peter and the apostles said in reply,
&quot;We must obey God rather than men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40M href="__PXZ.HTM#$40M">4</a></sup></font></sup> The God of our ancestors raised Jesus, though
you had him killed by hanging him on a tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>God exalted him at his right hand <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40N href="__PXZ.HTM#$40N">5</a></sup></font></sup>
as leader and savior to grant Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We are witnesses of these things, as is the
holy Spirit that God has given to those who obey him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard this, they became infuriated
and wanted to put them to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40O href="__PXZ.HTM#$40O">6</a></sup></font></sup> But a Pharisee in the Sanhedrin named
Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, respected by all the people, stood up, ordered
the men to be put outside for a short time, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and said to them, &quot;Fellow Israelites, be
careful what you are about to do to these men. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-40P href="__PXZ.HTM#$40P">7</a></sup></font></sup> Some time ago, Theudas appeared, claiming to
be someone important, and about four hundred men joined him, but he was killed,
and all those who were loyal to him were disbanded and came to nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After him came Judas the Galilean at the time
of the census. He also drew people after him, but he too perished and all who
were loyal to him were scattered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So now I tell you, have nothing to do with
these men, and let them go. For if this endeavor or this activity is of human
origin, it will destroy itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if it comes from God, you will not be able
to destroy them; you may even find yourselves fighting against God.&quot; They
were persuaded by him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After recalling the apostles, they had them
flogged, ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus, and dismissed
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin,
rejoicing that they had been found worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of
the name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And all day long, both at the temple and in
their homes, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the Messiah, Jesus. </p>

deception of the community. Their deaths are ascribed to a lie to the holy
Spirit (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 5:3, 9),

especially because of their charismatic power to heal the sick; cf
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXW.HTM#GOSP.ACT.2.42"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 2:42-47;

4:1-3. The motive is the jealousy of the religious authorities over
the popularity of the apostles (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 5:17) who are
now charged with the defiance of the Sanhedrin's previous order to them to abandon
their prophetic role (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 5:28; cf
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXY.HTM#GOSP.ACT.4.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 4:18). In this crisis the apostles are
favored by a miraculous release from prison (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
5:18-24). (For similar incidents involving Peter and Paul, see
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY6.HTM#GOSP.ACT.12.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 12:6-11;
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYA.HTM#GOSP.ACT.16.25"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 16:25-29.) The real significance of such an
event, however, would be manifest only to people of faith, not to unbelievers;
since the Sanhedrin already judged the Twelve to be inauthentic prophets, it
could disregard reports of their miracles. When the Twelve immediately resumed
public teaching, the Sanhedrin determined to invoke upon them the penalty of
death (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.33"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 5:33) prescribed in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P4S.HTM#PENT.DEU.13.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Deut 13:6-10. Gamaliel's advice against this
course finally prevailed, but it did not save the Twelve from the punishment of
scourging (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXZ.HTM#GOSP.ACT.5.40"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 5:40) in a last endeavor to shake
their conviction of their prophetic mission.</p>

unsuccessful contemporary movements to argue that if God is not the origin of
this movement preached by the apostles it will perish by itself. The movement
initiated by Theudas actually occurred when C. Cuspius Fadus was governor, A.D.
44-46. Luke's placing of Judas the Galilean after Theudas and at the time of
the census (see the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWL.HTM#GOSP.LUK.2.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 2:1-2) is an
