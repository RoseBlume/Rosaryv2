<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 40</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some time afterward, the royal cupbearer and
baker gave offense to their lord, the king of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh was angry with his two courtiers, the
chief cupbearer and the chief baker, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he put them in custody in the house of the
chief steward (the same jail where Joseph was confined). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The chief steward assigned Joseph to them, and
he became their attendant. After they had been in custody for some time, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the cupbearer and the baker of the king of
Egypt who were confined in the jail both had dreams on the same night, each
dream with its own meaning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he
noticed that they looked disturbed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he asked Pharaoh's courtiers who were with
him in custody in his master's house, &quot;Why do you look so sad today?&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered him, &quot;We have had dreams,
but there is no one to interpret them for us.&quot; Joseph said to them, &quot;Surely,
interpretations come from God. Please tell the dreams to me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream.
&quot;In my dream,&quot; he said, &quot;I saw a vine in front of me, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and on the vine were three branches. It had
barely budded when its blossoms came out, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; so I took the
grapes, pressed them out into his cup, and put it in Pharaoh's hand.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph said to him: &quot;This is what it
means. The three branches are three days; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-5Y href="__P16.HTM#$5Y">1</a></sup></font></sup> within three days Pharaoh will lift up your
head and restore you to your post. You will be handing Pharaoh his cup as you
formerly used to do when you were his cupbearer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So if you will still remember, when all is well
with you, that I was here with you, please do me the favor of mentioning me to
Pharaoh, to get me out of this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The truth is that I was kidnaped from the land
of the Hebrews, and here I have not done anything for which I should have been
put into a dungeon.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given
this favorable interpretation, he said to him: &quot;I too had a dream. In it I
had three wicker baskets on my head; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>in the top one were all kinds of bakery
products for Pharaoh, but the birds were pecking at them out of the basket on
my head.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph said to him in reply: &quot;This is what
it means. The three baskets are three days; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>within three days Pharaoh will lift up your
head and have you impaled on a stake, and the birds will be pecking the flesh
from your body.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And in fact, on the third day, which was
Pharaoh's birthday, when he gave a banquet to all his staff, with his courtiers
around him, he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and chief baker. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He restored the chief cupbearer to his office,
so that he again handed the cup to Pharaoh; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but the chief baker he impaled-just as Joseph
had told them in his interpretation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet the chief cupbearer gave no thought to
Joseph; he had forgotten him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
