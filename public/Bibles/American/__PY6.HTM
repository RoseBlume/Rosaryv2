</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42C href="__PY6.HTM#$42C">1</a></sup></font></sup> About that time King Herod laid hands upon
some members of the church to harm them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had James, the brother of John, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42D href="__PY6.HTM#$42D">2</a></sup></font></sup>
killed by the sword, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42E href="__PY6.HTM#$42E">3</a></sup></font></sup> and when he saw that this was pleasing to the
Jews he proceeded to arrest Peter also. (It was (the) feast of Unleavened
Bread.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He had him taken into custody and put in prison
under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. He intended to bring him
before the people after Passover. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Peter thus was being kept in prison, but prayer
by the church was fervently being made to God on his behalf. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the very night before Herod was to bring him
to trial, Peter, secured by double chains, was sleeping between two soldiers,
while outside the door guards kept watch on the prison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and
a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him,
saying, &quot;Get up quickly.&quot; The chains fell from his wrists. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The angel said to him, &quot;Put on your belt
and your sandals.&quot; He did so. Then he said to him, &quot;Put on your cloak
and follow me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he followed him out, not realizing that what
was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They passed the first guard, then the second,
and came to the iron gate leading out to the city, which opened for them by
itself. They emerged and made their way down an alley, and suddenly the angel
left him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Peter recovered his senses and said,
&quot;Now I know for certain that (the) Lord sent his angel and rescued me from
the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he realized this, he went to the house of
Mary, the mother of John who is called Mark, where there were many people
gathered in prayer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he knocked on the gateway door, a maid
named Rhoda came to answer it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She was so overjoyed when she recognized
Peter's voice that, instead of opening the gate, she ran in and announced that
Peter was standing at the gate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They told her, &quot;You are out of your
mind,&quot; but she insisted that it was so. But they kept saying, &quot;It is
his angel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Peter continued to knock, and when they
opened it, they saw him and were astounded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet
and explained (to them) how the Lord had led him out of the prison, and said,
&quot;Report this to James <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42F href="__PY6.HTM#$42F">4</a></sup></font></sup> and the brothers.&quot; Then he
left and went to another place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At daybreak there was no small commotion among
the soldiers over what had become of Peter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Herod, after instituting a search but not
finding him, ordered the guards tried and executed. Then he left Judea to spend
some time in Caesarea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42G href="__PY6.HTM#$42G">5</a></sup></font></sup> He had long been very angry with the people of
Tyre and Sidon, who now came to him in a body. After winning over Blastus, the
king's chamberlain, they sued for peace because their country was supplied with
food from the king's territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On an appointed day, Herod, attired in royal
robes, (and) seated on the rostrum, addressed them publicly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The assembled crowd cried out, &quot;This is
the voice of a god, not of a man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At once the angel of the Lord struck him down
because he did not ascribe the honor to God, and he was eaten by worms and
breathed his last. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the word of God continued to spread and
grow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After Barnabas and Saul completed their relief
mission, they returned to Jerusalem, <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-42H href="__PY6.HTM#$42H">6</a></sup></font></sup> taking with them
John, who is called Mark. </p>

A.D. 41-44. While Luke does not assign a motive for his execution of James and
his intended execution of Peter, the broad background lies in Herod's support
of Pharisaic Judaism. The Jewish Christians had lost the popularity they had
had in Jerusalem (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXW.HTM#GOSP.ACT.2.47"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 2:47), perhaps because of
suspicions against them traceable to the teaching of Stephen. </p>

1:19), who in Acts 15; 21 is presented as leader of the Jerusalem
Christian community. He left and went to another place: the conjecture that
Peter left for Rome at this time has nothing to recommend it. His chief
responsibility was still the leadership of the Jewish Christian community in
Palestine (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P102.HTM#NTLET.GAL.2.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Gal 2:7). The concept of the great
missionary effort of the church was yet to come (see <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PY7.HTM#GOSP.ACT.13.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts
