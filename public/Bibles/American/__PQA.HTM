Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, the eighteenth
year of Nebuchadnezzar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At that time the army of the king of Babylon
was besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was imprisoned in the
quarters of the guard, at the king's palace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zedekiah, king of Judah, had imprisoned him
there, remonstrating: &quot;How dare you prophesy: Thus says the LORD: I am
handing over this city to the king of Babylon, who will capture it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Neither shall Zedekiah, king of Judah, escape
the hands of the Chaldeans; rather shall he be handed over to the king of
Babylon. They shall meet and speak face to face, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Zedekiah shall be taken to Babylon. There
he shall remain, until I attend to him, says the LORD; in fighting the
Chaldeans, you cannot win!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EE href="__PQA.HTM#$2EE">3</a></sup></font></sup> This message came to me from the LORD, said
Jeremiah: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EF href="__PQA.HTM#$2EF">4</a></sup></font></sup> Hanamel, son of your uncle Shallum, will come
to you with the offer: &quot;Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, since you,
as nearest relative, have the first right of purchase.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then, as the LORD foretold, Hanamel, my uncle's
son, came to me to the quarters of the guard and said, &quot;Please buy my
field in Anathoth, in the district of Benjamin; as nearest relative, you have the
first claim to possess it; make it yours.&quot; I knew this was what the LORD
meant, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so I bought the field in Anathoth from my
cousin Hanamel, paying him the money, seventeen silver shekels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I had written and sealed the deed, called
witnesses and weighed out the silver on the scales, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EG href="__PQA.HTM#$2EG">5</a></sup></font></sup> I accepted the deed of purchase, both the
sealed copy, containing title and conditions, and the open one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This deed of purchase I gave to Baruch, son of
Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the
witnesses who had signed the deed, and before all the men of Judah who happened
to be in the quarters of the guard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In their presence I gave Baruch this charge: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EH href="__PQA.HTM#$2EH">6</a></sup></font></sup> Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of
Israel: Take these deeds, both the sealed and the open deed of purchase, and
put them in an earthen jar, so that they can be kept there a long time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of
Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After giving the deed of purchase to Baruch,
son of Neriah, I prayed thus to the LORD: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ah, Lord GOD, you have made heaven and earth by
your great might, with your outstretched arm; nothing is impossible to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You continue your kindness through a thousand
generations; and you repay the fathers' guilt, even into the lap of their sons
who follow them. O God, great and mighty, whose name is LORD of hosts, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>great in counsel, mighty in deed, whose eyes
are open to all the ways of men, giving to each according to his ways, according
to the fruit of his deeds: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>you have wrought signs and wonders in the land
of Egypt and to this day, both in Israel and among all other men, until now you
have gained renown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With strong hand and outstretched arm you
brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt amid signs and wonders and
great terror. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This land you gave them, as you had promised
their fathers under oath, a land flowing with milk and honey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They entered and took possession of it, but
they did not listen to your voice; by your law they did not live, and what you
commanded they failed to do. Hence you let all these evils befall them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See, the siegeworks have arrived at this city
to breach it; the city will be handed over to the Chaldeans who are attacking
it, amid sword, famine, and pestilence. What you threatened has happened, you
see it yourself; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and yet you tell me, O Lord GOD: Buy the field
with money, call in witnesses. But the city has already been handed over to the
Chaldeans! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then this word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I am the LORD, the God of all mankind! Is
anything impossible to me? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This now is what the LORD says: I will hand
over this city to the Chaldeans, for Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to take. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Chaldeans who are attacking it shall enter
this city and set fire to it, burning it and its houses, on the roofs of which
incense was burned to Baal and libations were poured out to strange gods as a
provocation to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites and the Judeans from their youth
have done only what is evil in my eyes; the Israelites did nothing but provoke
me with the works of their hands, says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From the day it was built to this day, this
city has excited my anger and wrath, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so that I must put it out of my sight for all
the wickedness the Israelites and Judeans, with their kings and their princes,
their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the citizens of
Jerusalem, have done to provoke me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They turned their backs to me, not their faces;
though I kept teaching them, they would not listen to my correction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They defiled the house named after me by the
horrid idols they set up in it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2EI href="__PQA.HTM#$2EI">7</a></sup></font></sup> They built high places to Baal in the Valley
of Ben-hinnom,
and immolated their sons and daughters to Molech, bringing sin upon Judah; this
I never commanded them, nor did it even enter my mind that they should practice
such abominations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of
Israel, concerning this city, which as you say is handed over to the king of
Babylon amid sword, famine, and pestilence: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Behold, I will gather them together from all
the lands to which in anger, wrath, and great rage I banish them; I will bring
them back to this place and settle them here in safety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall be my people, and I will be their
God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One heart and one way I will give them, that
they may fear me always, to their own good and that of their children after
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will make with them an eternal covenant,
never to cease doing good to them; into their hearts I will put the fear of me,
that they may never depart from me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will take delight in doing good to them: I
will replant them firmly in this land, with all my heart and soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For thus says the LORD: Just as I brought upon this
people all this great evil, so I will bring upon them all the good I promise
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fields shall again be bought in this land,
which you call a desert, without man or beast, handed over to the Chaldeans. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Fields shall be bought with money, deeds
written and sealed, and witnesses shall be used in the land of Benjamin, in the
suburbs of Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah and of the hill country, in the
cities of the foothills and of the Negeb, when I change their lot, says the
LORD. </p>
