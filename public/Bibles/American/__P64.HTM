</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MD href="__P64.HTM#$MD">1</a></sup></font></sup> After the death of Joshua the Israelites
consulted the LORD, asking, &quot;Who shall be first among us to attack the
Canaanites and to do battle with them?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD answered, &quot;Judah shall attack: I
have delivered the land into his power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah then said to his brother Simeon,
&quot;Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, and let us engage the
Canaanites in battle. I will likewise accompany you into the territory allotted
to you.&quot; So Simeon went with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the forces of Judah attacked, the LORD
delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their power, and they slew ten
thousand of them in Bezek. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was in Bezek that they came upon Adonibezek
and fought against him. When they defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Adonibezek fled. They set out in pursuit, and
when they caught him, cut off his thumbs and his big toes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this Adonibezek said, &quot;Seventy kings,
with their thumbs and big toes cut off, used to pick up scraps under my table.
As I have done, so has God repaid me.&quot; He was brought to Jerusalem, and
there he died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The Judahites fought against Jerusalem and
captured it, putting it to the sword; then they destroyed the city by fire.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Afterward the Judahites went down to fight
against the Canaanites who lived in the mountain region, in the Negeb, and in
the foothills. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah also marched against the Canaanites who dwelt
in Hebron, which was formerly called Kiriath-arba, and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman
and Talmai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From there they marched against the inhabitants
of Debir, which was formerly called Kiriath-sepher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Caleb said, &quot;I will give my daughter
Achsah in marriage to the one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it.&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Othniel, son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz,
captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the day of her marriage to Othniel she
induced him to ask her father for some land. Then, as she alighted from the
ass, Caleb asked her, &quot;What is troubling you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give me an additional gift,&quot; she answered.
&quot;Since you have assigned land in the Negeb to me, give me also pools of
water.&quot; So Caleb gave her the upper and the lower pool. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-ME href="__P64.HTM#$ME">2</a></sup></font></sup> The descendants of the Kenite, Moses'
father-in-law, came up with the Judahites from the city of palms to the desert
at Arad (which is in the Negeb). But they later left and settled among the
Amalekites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah then went with his brother Simeon, and
they defeated the Canaanites who dwelt in Zephath. After having doomed the city
to destruction, they renamed it Hormah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Judah, however, did not occupy Gaza with its
territory, Ashkelon with its territory, or Ekron with its territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since the LORD was with Judah, he gained
possession of the mountain region. Yet he could not dislodge those who lived on
the plain, because they had iron chariots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Moses had commanded, Hebron was given to
Caleb, who then drove from it the three sons of Anak. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-MF href="__P64.HTM#$MF">3</a></sup></font></sup> The Benjaminites did not dislodge the
Jebusites who dwelt in Jerusalem, with the result that the Jebusites live in
Jerusalem beside the Benjaminites to the present day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The house of Joseph, too, marched up against
Bethel, and the LORD was with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The house of Joseph had a reconnaissance made
of Bethel, which formerly was called Luz. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The scouts saw a man coming out of the city and
said to him, &quot;Show us a way into the city, and we will spare you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He showed them a way into the city, which they
then put to the sword; but they let the man and his whole clan go free. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then went to the land of the Hittites, where
he built a city and called it Luz, as it is still called. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean
with its towns or of Taanach with its towns. Neither did he dislodge the
inhabitants of Dor and its towns, those of Ibleam and its towns, or those of
Megiddo and its towns. The Canaanites kept their hold in this district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the Israelites grew stronger, they
impressed the Canaanites as laborers, but did not drive them out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Similarly, the Ephraimites did not drive out
the Canaanites living in Gezer, and so the Canaanites live in Gezer in their
midst. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Zebulun did not dislodge the inhabitants of
Kitron or those of Nahalol; the Canaanites live among them, but have become
forced laborers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco
or those of Sidon, or take possession of Mahaleb, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik or
Rehob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Asherites live among the Canaanite natives
of the land, whom they have not dislodged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of
Beth-shemesh or those of Beth-anath, and so they live among the Canaanite
natives of the land. However, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath
have become forced laborers for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Amorites hemmed in the Danites in the
mountain region, not permitting them to go down into the plain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Amorites had a firm hold in Harheres,
Aijalon and Shaalbim, but as the house of Joseph gained the upper hand, they
were impressed as laborers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The territory of the Amorites extended from the
Akrabbim pass to Sela and beyond. </p>
