<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 6</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MI href="__PSR.HTM#$2MI">1</a></sup></font></sup> And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom
at the age of sixty-two. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Darius decided to appoint over his entire
kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, to safeguard his interests; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>these were accountable to three supervisors,
one of whom was Daniel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel outshone all the supervisors and satraps
because an extraordinary spirit was in him, and the king thought of giving him
authority over the entire kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore the supervisors and satraps tried to
find grounds for accusation against Daniel as regards the administration. But
they could accuse him of no wrongdoing; because he was trustworthy, no fault of
neglect or misconduct was to be found in him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then these men said to themselves, &quot;We shall
find no grounds for accusation against this Daniel unless by way of the law of
his God.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So these supervisors and satraps went thronging
to the king and said to him, &quot;King Darius, live forever! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the supervisors of the kingdom, the
prefects, satraps, nobles, and governors are agreed that the following
prohibition ought to be put in force by royal decree: no one is to address any
petition to god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king; otherwise he
shall be cast into a den of lions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MJ href="__PSR.HTM#$2MJ">2</a></sup></font></sup> Now, O king, issue the prohibition over your
signature, immutable and irrevocable under Mede and Persian law.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So King Darius signed the prohibition and made
it law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even after Daniel heard that this law had been
signed, he continued his custom of going home to kneel in prayer and give
thanks to his God in the upper chamber three times a day, with the windows open
toward Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So these men rushed in and found Daniel praying
and pleading before his God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they went to remind the king about the
prohibition: &quot;Did you not decree, O king, that no one is to address a
petition to god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king; otherwise he
shall be cast into a den of lions?&quot; The king answered them, &quot;The
decree is absolute, irrevocable under the Mede and Persian law.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To this they replied, &quot;Daniel, the Jewish
exile, has paid no attention to you, O king, or to the decree you issued; three
times a day he offers his prayer.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king was deeply grieved at this news and he
made up his mind to save Daniel; he worked till sunset to rescue him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But these men insisted. &quot;Keep in mind, O
king,&quot; they said, &quot;that under the Mede and Persian law every royal
prohibition or decree is irrevocable.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2MK href="__PSR.HTM#$2MK">3</a></sup></font></sup> So the king ordered Daniel to be brought and
cast into the lions' den. To Daniel he said, &quot;May your God, whom you serve
so constantly, save you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To forestall any tampering, the king sealed
with his own ring and the rings of the lords the stone that had been brought to
block the opening of the den. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king returned to his palace for the
night; he refused to eat and he dismissed the entertainers. Since sleep was
impossible for him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king rose very early the next morning and
hastened to the lions' den. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he drew near, he cried out to Daniel
sorrowfully, &quot;O Daniel, servant of the living God, has the God whom you
serve so constantly been able to save you from the lions?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daniel answered the king: &quot;O king, live
forever! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My God has sent his angel and closed the lions'
mouths so that they have not hurt me. For I have been found innocent before
him; neither to you have I done any harm, O king!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This gave the king great joy. At his order
Daniel was removed from the den, unhurt because he trusted in his God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then ordered the men who had accused
Daniel, along with their children and their wives, to be cast into the lions'
den. Before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and
crushed all their bones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King Darius wrote to the nations and
peoples of every language, wherever they dwell on the earth: &quot;All peace to
you! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I decree that throughout my royal domain the
God of Daniel is to be reverenced and feared: &quot;For he is the living God,
enduring forever; his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be
without end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He is a deliverer and savior, working signs and
wonders in heaven and on earth, and he delivered Daniel from the lions'
power.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Daniel fared well during the reign of Darius
and the reign of Cyrus the Persian. </p>

profane history. The Median kingdom had already been conquered by Cyrus the
Persian, and it was Cyrus who captured Babylon. Evidently the author of Daniel
has deliberately adopted an apocalyptic view of history, derived from prophecy
(cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNW.HTM#PROPHB.ISA.13.17"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Isaiah 13:17-19; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PQT.HTM#PROPHB.JER.51.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Jeremiah
51:11, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PQT.HTM#PROPHB.JER.51.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 28-30), according to which the
Medes formed the second of four world kingdoms preceding the messianic times;
see note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSN.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.2.36"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 2:36-45. The character of
Darius the Mede has probably been modeled on that of the Persian King Darius
the Great (522-486 B.C.), the second successor of Cyrus. </p>
