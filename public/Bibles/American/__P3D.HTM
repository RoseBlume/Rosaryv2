<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Moses, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Speak to the Israelites and tell them:
When anyone fulfills a vow of offering one or more persons to the LORD, who are
to be ransomed at a fixed sum of money, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for persons between the ages of twenty and
sixty, the fixed sum, in sanctuary shekels, shall be fifty silver shekels for a
man, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and thirty shekels for a woman; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for persons between the ages of five and
twenty, the fixed sum shall be twenty shekels for a youth, and ten for a
maiden; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for persons between the ages of one month and
five years, the fixed sum shall be five silver shekels for a boy, and three for
a girl; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for persons of sixty or more, the fixed sum
shall be fifteen shekels for a man, and ten for a woman. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, if the one who took the vow is too
poor to meet the fixed sum, the person must be set before the priest, who shall
determine the sum for his ransom in keeping with the means of the one who made
the vow. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If the offering vowed to the LORD is an
animal that may be sacrificed, every such animal, when vowed to the LORD,
becomes sacred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The offerer shall not present a substitute for
it by exchanging either a better for a worse one or a worse for a better one.

its substitute shall be treated as sacred. </p>

shall pay one fifth more than this valuation. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If the one who dedicated his house wishes to
redeem it, he shall pay one fifth more than the price thus established, and
then it will again be his. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If the object which someone dedicates to
the LORD is a piece of his hereditary land, its valuation shall be made
according to the amount of seed required to sow it, the acreage sown with a
homer of barley seed being valued at fifty silver shekels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If the dedication of a field is made at the
beginning of a jubilee period, the full valuation shall hold; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but if it is some time after this, the priest
shall estimate its money value according to the number of years left until the
next jubilee year, with a corresponding rebate on the valuation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If the one who dedicated his field wishes to
redeem it, he shall pay one fifth more than the price thus established, and so
reclaim it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If, instead of redeeming such a field, he sells
it to someone else, it may no longer be redeemed; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but at the jubilee it shall be released as
sacred to the LORD; like a field that is doomed, it shall become priestly
property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If the field that some man dedicates to
the LORD is one he had purchased and not a part of his hereditary property, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the priest shall compute its value in
proportion to the number of years until the next jubilee, and on the same day
the price thus established shall be given as sacred to the LORD; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>at the jubilee, however, the field shall revert
to the hereditary owner of this land from whom it had been purchased. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Every valuation shall be made according
to the standard of the sanctuary shekel. There are twenty gerahs to the shekel.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Note that a first-born animal, which as
such already belongs to the LORD, may not be dedicated by vow to him. If it is
an ox or a sheep, it shall be ceded to the LORD; </p>

it shall be sold at its fixed value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Note, also, that any one of his
possessions which a man vows as doomed to the LORD, whether it is a human being
