<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7S href="__P1O.HTM#$7S">1</a></sup></font></sup> The LORD answered him, &quot;See! I have made
you as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall act as your prophet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You shall tell him all that I command you. In
turn, your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites leave his
land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet I will make Pharaoh so obstinate that,
despite the many signs and wonders that I will work in the land of Egypt, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he will not listen to you. Therefore I will lay
my hand on Egypt and by great acts of judgment I will bring the hosts of my
people, the Israelites, out of the land of Egypt, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>so that the Egyptians may learn that I am the
LORD, as I stretch out my hand against Egypt and lead the Israelites out of
their midst.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses and Aaron did as the LORD had commanded
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three
when they spoke to Pharaoh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD told Moses and Aaron, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If Pharaoh demands that you work a sign
or wonder, you shall say to Aaron: Take your staff and throw it down before
Pharaoh, and it will be changed into a snake.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as
the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his
servants, and it was changed into a snake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh, in turn, summoned wise men and
sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did likewise by their magic
arts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each one threw down his staff, and it was
changed into a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh, however, was obstinate and would not
listen to them, just as the LORD had foretold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7T href="__P1O.HTM#$7T">2</a></sup></font></sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Pharaoh is
obdurate in refusing to let the people go. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Tomorrow morning, when he sets out for the
water, go and present yourself by the river bank, holding in your hand the
staff that turned into a serpent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Say to him: The LORD, the God of the Hebrews,
sent me to you with the message: Let my people go to worship me in the desert.
But as yet you have not listened. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD now says: This is how you shall know
that I am the LORD. I will strike the water of the river with the staff I hold,
and it shall be changed into blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The fish in the river shall die, and the river
itself shall become so polluted that the Egyptians will be unable to drink its
water.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD then said to Moses, &quot;Say to
Aaron: Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt -
their streams and canals and pools, all their supplies of water - that they may
become blood. Throughout the land of Egypt there shall be blood, even in the
wooden pails and stone jars.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses and Aaron did as the LORD had commanded.
Aaron raised his staff and struck the waters of the river in full view of
Pharaoh and his servants, and all the water of the river was changed into
blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The fish in the river died, and the river
itself became so polluted that the Egyptians could not drink its water. There
was blood throughout the land of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Egyptian magicians did the same by
their magic arts. So Pharaoh remained obstinate and would not listen to Moses
and Aaron, just as the LORD had foretold. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He turned away and went into his house, with no
concern even for this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the Egyptians had to dig in the
neighborhood of the river for drinking water, since they could not drink the
river water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the
river. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-7U href="__P1O.HTM#$7U">3</a></sup></font></sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Go to
Pharaoh and tell him: Thus says the LORD: Let my people go to worship me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you refuse to let them go, I warn you, I
will send a plague of frogs over all your territory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The river will teem with frogs. They will come
up into your palace and into your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of
your servants, too, and your subjects, even into your ovens and your kneading
bowls. </p>
