<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 18</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Moses' father-in-law Jethro, the priest of
Midian, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel: how
the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So his father-in-law Jethro took along
Zipporah, Moses' wife, whom Moses had sent back to him, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and her two sons. One of these was called Gershom;
for he said, &quot;I am a stranger in a foreign land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The other was called Eliezer; for he said,
&quot;My father's God is my helper; he has rescued me from Pharaoh's
sword.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Together with Moses' wife and sons, then, his father-in-law
Jethro came to him in the desert where he was encamped near the mountain of
God, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and he sent word to Moses, &quot;I, Jethro,
your father-in-law, am coming to you, along with your wife and her two
sons.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed
down before him, and kissed him. Having greeted each other, they went into the
tent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses then told his father-in-law of all that
the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for the sake of Israel, and of
all the hardships they had had to endure on their journey, and how the LORD had
come to their rescue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jethro rejoiced over all the goodness that the
LORD had shown Israel in rescuing them from the hands of the Egyptians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Blessed be the LORD,&quot; he said,
&quot;who has rescued his people from the hands of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now I know that the LORD is a deity great
beyond any other; for he took occasion of their being dealt with insolently to
deliver the people from the power of the Egyptians.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses,
brought a holocaust and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the
elders of Israel to participate with Moses' father-in-law in the meal before
God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day Moses sat in judgment for the
people, who waited about him from morning until evening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When his father-in-law saw all that he was
doing for the people, he inquired, &quot;What sort of thing is this that you
are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone while all the people have to
stand about you from morning till evening?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses answered his father-in-law, &quot;The
people come to me to consult God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whenever they have a disagreement, they come to
me to have me settle the matter between them and make known to them God's
decisions and regulations.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You are not acting wisely,&quot; his
father-in-law replied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You will surely wear yourself out, and
not only yourself but also these people with you. The task is too heavy for
you; you cannot do it alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, listen to me, and I will give you some
advice, that God may be with you. Act as the people's representative before
God, bringing to him whatever they have to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Enlighten them in regard to the decisions and
regulations, showing them how they are to live and what they are to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you should also look among all the people
for able and God-fearing men, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain, and set
them as officers over groups of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Let these men render decisions for the people
in all ordinary cases. More important cases they should refer to you, but all
the lesser cases they can settle themselves. Thus, your burden will be
lightened, since they will bear it with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you do this, when God gives you orders you
will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home
satisfied.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses followed the advice of his father-in-law
and did all that he had suggested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He picked out able men from all Israel and put
them in charge of the people as officers over groups of thousands, of hundreds,
of fifties, and of tens. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They rendered decisions for the people in all
ordinary cases. The more difficult cases they referred to Moses, but all the
lesser cases they settled themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Moses bade farewell to his father-in-law,
who went off to his own country. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
