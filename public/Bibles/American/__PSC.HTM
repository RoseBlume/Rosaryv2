This lengthy vision of the new Israel is dated (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSC.HTM#PROPHB.EZE.40.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Ezekiel
40:1) April 28, 573 B.C. It is largely concerned with the new temple
and the prescriptions to govern it, but other details of the restored
commonwealth are included, forming a kind of program for the future. The
literary form of the vision has been aptly termed &quot;utopian&quot;: it is
plain that the prophet did not expect a literal fulfillment of much of what he
described. The passage doubtless underwent successive additions, both from the
prophet and from later inspired writers. </p>

ordinary cubit consisted of six handbreadths; the great cubit, of seven. In
measuring the temple, a rod six great cubits long was used. The ordinary cubit
was about one and a half feet, or, more exactly, 17.5 inches; the large cubit,
20.4 inches.</p>
