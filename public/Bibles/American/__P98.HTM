</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elisha once said to the woman whose son he had
restored to life: &quot;Get ready! Leave with your family and settle wherever
you can, because the LORD has decreed a seven-year famine which is coming upon
the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The woman got ready and did as the man of God
said, setting out with her family and settling in the land of the Philistines
for seven years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the end of the seven years, the woman
returned from the land of the Philistines and went out to the king to claim her
house and her field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king was talking with Gehazi, the servant
of the man of God. &quot;Tell me,&quot; he said, &quot;all the great things
that Elisha has done.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Just as he was relating to the king how his
master had restored a dead person to life, the very woman whose son Elisha had
restored to life came to the king to claim her house and field. &quot;My lord
king,&quot; Gehazi said, &quot;this is the woman, and this is that son of hers
whom Elisha restored to life.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T6 href="__P98.HTM#$T6">1</a></sup></font></sup> The king questioned the woman, and she told
him her story. With that the king placed an official at her disposal, saying,
&quot;Restore all her property to her, with all that the field produced from
the day she left the land until now.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Elisha came to Damascus at a time when
Ben-hadad, king of Aram, lay sick. When he was told that the man of God had
come there, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king said to Hazael, &quot;Take a gift with
you and go call on the man of God. Have him consult the LORD as to whether I
shall recover from this sickness.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hazael went to visit him, carrying a present,
and with forty camel loads of the best goods of Damascus. On his arrival, he
stood before the prophet and said, &quot;Your son Ben-hadad, king of Aram, has
sent me to ask you whether he will recover from his sickness.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Go and tell him,&quot; Elisha answered,
&quot;that he will surely recover. However, the LORD has showed me that he will
in fact die.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he stared him down until Hazael became ill
at ease. The man of God wept, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and Hazael asked, &quot;Why are you weeping, my
lord?&quot; Elisha replied, &quot;Because I know the evil that you will inflict
upon the Israelites. You will burn their fortresses, you will slay their youth
with the sword, you will dash their little children to pieces, you will rip
open their pregnant women.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T7 href="__P98.HTM#$T7">2</a></sup></font></sup> Hazael exclaimed, &quot;How can a dog like me,
your servant, do anything so important?&quot; &quot;The LORD has showed you to
me as king over Aram,&quot; replied Elisha. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master.
&quot;What did Elisha tell you?&quot; asked Ben-hadad. &quot;He told me that
you would surely recover,&quot; replied Hazael. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day, however, Hazael took a cloth,
dipped it in water, and spread it over the king's face, so that he died. And
Hazael reigned in his stead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-T8 href="__P98.HTM#$T8">3</a></sup></font></sup> In the fifth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king
of Israel, Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, became king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was thirty-two years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He conducted himself like the kings of Israel
of the line of Ahab, since the sister of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in
the LORD'S sight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even so, the LORD was unwilling to destroy
Judah, because of his servant David. For he had promised David that he would
leave him a lamp in the LORD'S presence for all time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During Jehoram's reign, Edom revolted against
the sovereignty of Judah and chose a king of its own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Jehoram with all his chariots crossed
over to Zair. He arose by night and broke through the Edomites when they had
surrounded him and the commanders of his chariots. Then his army fled homeward.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To this day Edom has been in revolt against the
rule of Judah. Libnah also revolted at that time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of the acts of Jehoram, with all that
he did, are recorded in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoram rested with his ancestors and was
buried with them in the City of David. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king. </p>

king in the twelfth year of Joram, son of Ahab, king of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was twenty-two years old when he began his
reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athaliah;
she was daughter of Omri, king of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He conducted himself like the house of Ahab,
doing evil in the LORD'S sight as they did, since he was related to them by
marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He joined Joram, son of Ahab, in battle against
Hazael, king of Aram, at Ramoth-gilead, where the Arameans wounded Joram. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Joram returned to Jezreel to be healed of
the wounds which the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah in his battle
against Hazael, king of Aram. Then Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went
down to Jezreel to visit him there in his illness. </p>
