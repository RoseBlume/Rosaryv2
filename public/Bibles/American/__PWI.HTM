Behold the place where they laid him. </p>

is to show that the tomb is empty and that Jesus has been raised
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWI.HTM#GOSP.MAR.16.6"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 16:6) and is going before you to Galilee
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWI.HTM#GOSP.MAR.16.7"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 16:7) in fulfillment of
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWG.HTM#GOSP.MAR.14.28"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 14:28. The women find the tomb empty, and an
angel stationed there announces to them what has happened. They are told to
proclaim the news to Peter and the disciples in order to prepare them for a
reunion with him. Mark's composition of the gospel ends at
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWI.HTM#GOSP.MAR.16.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark 16:8 with the women telling no one, because
they were afraid. This abrupt termination causes some to believe that the
original ending of this gospel may have been lost. See the following note. </p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3H5 href="__PWI.HTM#-3H5">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [9-20] This passage, termed the
Longer Ending to the Marcan gospel by comparison with a much briefer conclusion
found in some less important manuscripts, has traditionally been accepted as a
canonical part of the gospel and was defined as such by the Council of Trent.
Early citations of it by the Fathers indicate that it was composed by the
second century, although vocabulary and style indicate that it was written by
someone other than Mark. It is a general resume of the material concerning the
appearances of the risen Jesus, reflecting, in particular, traditions found in
Luke 24 and John 20. The Shorter Ending: Found after <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWI.HTM#GOSP.MAR.16.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Mark
16:8 before the Longer Ending in four seventh-to-ninth-century Greek
manuscripts as well as in one Old Latin version, where it appears alone without
the Longer Ending. The Freer Logion: Found after v 14 in a fourth-fifth century
manuscript preserved in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, this ending
was known to Jerome in the fourth century. It reads: &quot;And they excused
themselves, saying, &quot;This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan,
who does not allow the truth and power of God to prevail over the unclean
things dominated by the spirits [or, does not allow the unclean things
dominated by the spirits to grasp the truth and power of God]. Therefore reveal
your righteousness now.' They spoke to Christ. And Christ responded to them,
&quot;The limit of the years of Satan's power is completed, but other terrible
things draw near. And for those who sinned I was handed over to death, that
they might return to the truth and no longer sin, in order that they might
inherit the spiritual and incorruptible heavenly glory of righteousness. But .
