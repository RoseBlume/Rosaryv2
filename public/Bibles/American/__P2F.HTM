<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Cut two stone
tablets like the former, that I may write on them the commandments which were
on the former tablets that you broke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Get ready for tomorrow morning, when you are to
go up Mount Sinai and there present yourself to me on the top of the mountain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No one shall come up with you, and no one is
even to be seen on any part of the mountain; even the flocks and the herds are
not to go grazing toward this mountain.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses then cut two stone tablets like the
former, and early the next morning he went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had
commanded him, taking along the two stone tablets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Having come down in a cloud, the LORD stood
with him there and proclaimed his name, &quot;LORD.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out,
&quot;The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and rich
in kindness and fidelity, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>continuing his kindness for a thousand
generations, and forgiving wickedness and crime and sin; yet not declaring the
guilty guiltless, but punishing children and grandchildren to the third and
fourth generation for their fathers' wickedness!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moses at once bowed down to the ground in
worship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said, &quot;If I find favor with you, O
Lord, do come along in our company. This is indeed a stiff-necked people; yet
pardon our wickedness and sins, and receive us as your own.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Here, then,&quot; said the LORD, &quot;is
the covenant I will make. Before the eyes of all your people I will work such
marvels as have never been wrought in any nation anywhere on earth, so that
this people among whom you live may see how awe-inspiring are the deeds which
I, the LORD, will do at your side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you, on your part, must keep the
commandments I am giving you today. &quot;I will drive out before you the
Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take care, therefore, not to make a covenant
with these inhabitants of the land that you are to enter; else they will become
a snare among you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AF href="__P2F.HTM#$AF">1</a></sup></font></sup> Tear down their altars; smash their sacred
pillars, and cut down their sacred poles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AG href="__P2F.HTM#$AG">2</a></sup></font></sup> You shall not worship any other god, for the
LORD is 'the Jealous One'; a jealous God is he. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of
that land; else, when they render their wanton worship to their gods and
sacrifice to them, one of them may invite you and you may partake of his
sacrifice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Neither shall you take their daughters as wives
for your sons; otherwise, when their daughters render their wanton worship to
their gods, they will make your sons do the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You shall not make for yourselves molten
gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You shall keep the feast of Unleavened
Bread. For seven days at the prescribed time in the month of Abib you are to
eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you; for in the month of Abib you came out
of Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;To me belongs every first-born male that
opens the womb among all your livestock, whether in the herd or in the flock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The firstling of an ass you shall redeem with
one of the flock; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. The
first-born among your sons you shall redeem. &quot;No one shall appear before
me empty-handed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;For six days you may work, but on the
seventh day you shall rest; on that day you must rest even during the seasons
of plowing and harvesting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AH href="__P2F.HTM#$AH">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;You shall keep the feast of Weeks with
the first of the wheat harvest; likewise, the feast at the fruit harvest at the
close of the year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Three times a year all your men shall appear
before the Lord, the LORD God of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since I will drive out the nations before you
to give you a large territory, there will be no one to covet your land when you
go up three times a year to appear before the LORD, your God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You shall not offer me the blood of
sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice of the Passover feast be
kept overnight for the next day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;The choicest first fruits of your soil
you shall bring to the house of the LORD, your God. &quot;You shall not boil a
kid in its mother's milk.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Write down
these words, for in accordance with them I have made a covenant with you and
with Israel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Moses stayed there with the LORD for forty
days and forty nights, without eating any food or drinking any water, and he
wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the
two tablets of the commandments in his hands, he did not know that the skin of
his face had become radiant while he conversed with the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Aaron, then, and the other Israelites saw
Moses and noticed how radiant the skin of his face had become, they were afraid
to come near him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only after Moses called to them did Aaron and
all the rulers of the community come back to him. Moses then spoke to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Later on, all the Israelites came up to him,
and he enjoined on them all that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-AI href="__P2F.HTM#$AI">4</a></sup></font></sup> When he finished speaking with them, he put a
veil over his face. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Whenever Moses entered the presence of the LORD
to converse with him, he removed the veil until he came out again. On coming
out, he would tell the Israelites all that had been commanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the Israelites would see that the skin of
Moses' face was radiant; so he would again put the veil over his face until he
went in to converse with the LORD. </p>
