<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he led me to the gate which faces the
east, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and there I saw the glory of the God of Israel
coming from the east. I heard a sound like the roaring of many waters, and the
earth shone with his glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The vision was like that which I had seen when
he came to destroy the city, and like that which I had seen by the river
Chebar. I fell prone </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>as the glory of the LORD entered the temple by
way of the gate which faces the east, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but spirit lifted me up and brought me to the
inner court. And I saw that the temple was filled with the glory of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I heard someone speaking to me from the
temple, while the man stood beside me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The voice said to me: Son of man, this is where
my throne shall be, this is where I will set the soles of my feet; here I will
dwell among the Israelites forever. Never again shall they and their kings
profane my holy name with their harlotries and with the corpses of their kings
(their high places). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2L9 href="__PSF.HTM#$2L9">1</a></sup></font></sup> When they placed their threshold against my
threshold and their doorpost next to mine, so that only a wall was between us,
they profaned my holy name by their abominable deeds; therefore I consumed them
in my wrath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From now on they shall put far from me their
harlotry and the corpses of their kings, and I will dwell in their midst
forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for you, son of man, describe the temple to
the house of Israel (that they may be ashamed of their sins), both its
measurements and its design; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(and if they are ashamed of all that they have
done,) make known to them the form and design of the temple, its exits and
entrances, all its statutes and laws; write these down for them to see, that
they may carefully observe all its laws and statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This is the law of the temple: its whole
surrounding area on the mountain top shall be most sacred. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2LA href="__PSF.HTM#$2LA">2</a></sup></font></sup> These were the measurements of the altar in
cubits of one cubit plus a handbreadth. Its base was one cubit high and one cubit
deep, with a rim around its edges of one span. The height of the altar itself
was as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>from its base at the bottom up to the lower
edge it was two cubits high, and this ledge was one cubit deep; from the lower
to the upper ledge it was four cubits high, and this ledge also was one cubit
deep; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the hearth of the altar was four cubits high,
and extending from the top of the hearth were the four horns of the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The hearth was a square: twelve cubits long and
twelve cubits wide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The upper ledge was also a square: fourteen
cubits long and fourteen cubits wide. The lower ledge, likewise a square, was
sixteen cubits long and sixteen cubits wide, with a half-cubit rim surrounding
it. And there was a base of one cubit all around. The steps of the altar face
the east. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to me: Son of man, thus says the
Lord GOD: These are the statutes for the altar when it is set up for the
offering of holocausts upon it and for the sprinkling of blood against it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give a young bull as a sin offering to the
priests, the Levites who are of the line of Zadok, who draw near me to minister
to me, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take some of its blood and put it on the four
horns of the altar, and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim all
around. Thus you shall purify it and make atonement for it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then take the bull of the sin offering, which
is to be burnt in a designated part of the temple, outside the sanctuary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the second day present an unblemished
he-goat as a sin offering, to purify the altar as was done with the bull. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When you have finished the purification, bring
an unblemished young bull and an unblemished ram from the flock, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and present them before the LORD; the priests
shall strew salt on them and offer them to the LORD as holocausts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Daily for seven days you shall offer a he-goat
as a sin offering, and a young bull and a ram from the flock, all unblemished,
shall be offered </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for seven days. Thus atonement shall be made
for the altar, and it shall be purified and dedicated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when these days are over, from the eighth
day on, the priests shall offer your holocausts and peace offerings on the
altar. Then I will accept you, says the Lord GOD. </p>
