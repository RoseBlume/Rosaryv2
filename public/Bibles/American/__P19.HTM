<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 43</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-66 href="__P19.HTM#$66">1</a></sup></font></sup> Now the famine in the land grew more severe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So when they had used up all the rations they
had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, &quot;Go back and procure us
a little more food.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Judah replied: &quot;The man strictly
warned us, 'You shall not appear in my presence unless your brother is with
you.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>If you are willing to let our brother go with
us, we will go down to procure food for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But if you are not willing, we will not go
down, because the man told us, 'You shall not appear in my presence unless your
brother is with you.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Israel demanded, &quot;Why did you bring this
trouble on me by telling the man that you had another brother?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered: &quot;The man kept asking about ourselves
and our family: 'Is your father still living? Do you have another brother?' We
had to answer his questions. How could we know that he would say, 'Bring your
brother down here'?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Judah urged his father Israel: &quot;Let
the boy go with me, that we may be off and on our way if you and we and our
children are to keep from starving to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I myself will stand surety for him. You can
hold me responsible for him. If I fail to bring him back, to set him in your presence,
you can hold it against me forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Had we not dilly-dallied, we could have been
there and back twice by now!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their father Israel then told them: &quot;If it
must be so, then do this: Put some of the land's best products in your baggage
and take them down to the man as gifts: some balm and honey, gum and resin, and
pistachios and almonds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Also take extra money along, for you must
return the amount that was put back in the mouths of your bags; it may have
been a mistake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Take your brother, too, and be off on your way
back to the man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>May God Almighty dispose the man to be merciful
toward you, so that he may let your other brother go, as well as Benjamin. As
for me, if I am to suffer bereavement, I shall suffer it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the men got the gifts, took double the
amount of money with them, and, accompanied by Benjamin, were off on their way
down to Egypt to present themselves to Joseph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he told his
head steward, &quot;Take these men into the house, and have an animal
slaughtered and prepared, for they are to dine with me at noon.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Doing as Joseph had ordered, the steward
conducted the men to Joseph's house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But on being led to his house, they became
apprehensive. &quot;It must be,&quot; they thought, &quot;on account of the
money put back in our bags the first time, that we are taken inside; they want
to use it as a pretext to attack us and take our donkeys and seize us as
slaves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they went up to Joseph's head steward and
talked to him at the entrance of the house. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If you please, sir,&quot; they said,
&quot;we came down here once before to procure food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when we arrived at a night's encampment and
opened our bags, there was each man's money in the mouth of his bag - our money
in the full amount! We have now brought it back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We have brought other money to procure food
with. We do not know who put the first money in our bags.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Be at ease,&quot; he replied; &quot;you
have no need to fear. Your God and the God of your father must have put
treasures in your bags for you. As for your money, I received it.&quot; With
that, he led Simeon out to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The steward then brought the men inside
Joseph's house. He gave them water to bathe their feet, and got fodder for
their donkeys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then they set out their gifts to await Joseph's
arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to dine there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joseph came home, they presented him with
the gifts they had brought inside, while they bowed down before him to the
ground. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After inquiring how they were, he asked them,
&quot;And how is your aged father, of whom you spoke? Is he still in good
health?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Your servant our father is thriving and
still in good health,&quot; they said, as they bowed respectfully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joseph's eye fell on his full brother
Benjamin, he asked, &quot;Is this your youngest brother, of whom you told
me?&quot; Then he said to him, &quot;May God be gracious to you, my boy!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>With that, Joseph had to hurry out, for he was
so overcome with affection for his brother that he was on the verge of tears.
He went into a private room and wept there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After washing his face, he reappeared and, now
in control of himself, gave the order, &quot;Serve the meal.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-67 href="__P19.HTM#$67">2</a></sup></font></sup> It was served separately to him, to the
brothers, and to the Egyptians who partook of his board. (Egyptians may not eat
with Hebrews; that is abhorrent to them.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they were seated by his directions
according to their age, from the oldest to the youngest, they looked at one
another in amazement; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-68 href="__P19.HTM#$68">3</a></sup></font></sup> and as portions were brought to them from Joseph's
table, Benjamin's portion was five times as large as anyone else's. So they
drank freely and made merry with him. </p>
