<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In those days the Philistines mustered their
military forces to fight against Israel. So Achish said to David, &quot;You
realize, of course, that you and your men must go out on campaign with me to
Jezreel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David answered Achish, &quot;Good! Now you
shall learn what your servant can do.&quot; Then Achish said to David, &quot;I
shall appoint you my permanent bodyguard.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Samuel had died and, after being mourned by
all Israel, was buried in his city, Ramah. Meanwhile Saul had driven mediums
and fortune-tellers out of the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Philistine levies advanced to Shunem and
encamped. Saul, too, mustered all Israel; they camped on Gilboa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he
was dismayed and lost heart completely. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He therefore consulted the LORD; but the LORD
gave no answer, whether in dreams or by the Urim or through prophets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul said to his servants, &quot;Find me a
woman who is a medium, to whom I can go to seek counsel through her.&quot; His
servants answered him, &quot;There is a woman in Endor who is a medium.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he disguised himself, putting on other
clothes, and set out with two companions. They came to the woman by night, and
Saul said to her, &quot;Tell my fortune through a ghost; conjure up for me the
one I ask you to.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the woman answered him, &quot;You are
surely aware of what Saul has done, in driving the mediums and fortune-tellers
out of the land. Why, then, are you laying snares for my life, to have me
killed?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Saul swore to her by the LORD, &quot;As the
LORD lives, you shall incur no blame for this.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the woman asked him, &quot;Whom do you
want me to conjure up?&quot; and he answered, &quot;Samuel.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QA href="__P7M.HTM#$QA">1</a></sup></font></sup> When the woman saw Samuel, she shrieked at the
top of her voice and said to Saul, &quot;Why have you deceived me? You are
Saul!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king said to her, &quot;Have no fear.
What do you see?&quot; The woman answered Saul, &quot;I see a preternatural
being rising from the earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;What does he look like?&quot; asked Saul.
And she replied, &quot;It is an old man who is rising, clothed in a
mantle.&quot; Saul knew that it was Samuel, and so he bowed face to the ground
in homage. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samuel then said to Saul, &quot;Why do you
disturb me by conjuring me up?&quot; Saul replied: &quot;I am in great straits,
for the Philistines are waging war against me and God has abandoned me. Since
he no longer answers me through prophets or in dreams, I have called you to
tell me what I should do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>To this Samuel said: &quot;But why do you ask
me, if the LORD has abandoned you and is with your neighbor? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD has done to you what he foretold
through me: he has torn the kingdom from your grasp and has given it to your
neighbor David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Because you disobeyed the LORD'S
directive and would not carry out his fierce anger against Amalek, the LORD has
done this to you today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, the LORD will deliver Israel, and you
as well, into the clutches of the Philistines. By tomorrow you and your sons
will be with me, and the LORD will have delivered the army of Israel into the
hands of the Philistines.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Immediately Saul fell full length on the
ground, for he was badly shaken by Samuel's message. Moreover, he had no bodily
strength left, since he had eaten nothing all that day and night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the woman came to Saul, and seeing that he
was quite terror-stricken, said to him: &quot;Remember, your maidservant obeyed
you: I took my life in my hands and fulfilled the request you made of me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now you, in turn, please listen to your
maidservant. Let me set something before you to eat, so that you may have
strength when you go on your way.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But he refused, saying, &quot;I will not
eat.&quot; However, when his servants joined the woman in urging him, he
listened to their entreaties, got up from the ground, and sat on a couch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The woman had a stall-fed calf in the house,
which she now quickly slaughtered. Then taking flour, she kneaded it and baked
unleavened bread. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She set the meal before Saul and his servants,
and they ate. Then they stood up and left the same night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

communicate at will with the souls of the dead. God may, however, permit a
departed soul to appear to the living and even to disclose things unknown to
them. Saul's own prohibition of necromancy and divination
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P7M.HTM#HIS.1SAM.28.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 1 Sam 28:3) was in keeping with the consistent
teaching of the Old Testament. If we are to credit the reality of the
apparition to Saul, it was due, not to the summons of the witch, but to God's
will; the woman merely furnished the occasion. <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
