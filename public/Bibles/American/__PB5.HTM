<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors; he was
buried with them in the City of David. Jehoram, his son, succeeded him as king.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat, were
Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael and Shephatiah; all these were
sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Their father gave them numerous gifts of
silver, gold and precious objects, together with fortified cities in Judah, but
the kingship he gave to Jehoram because he was the first-born. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Jehoram had come into his father's kingdom
and had consolidated his power, he put to the sword all his brothers and also
some of the princes of Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became
king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WR href="__PB5.HTM#$WR">1</a></sup></font></sup> He conducted himself like the kings of Israel
of the line of Ahab, because one of Ahab's daughters was his wife. He did evil
in the sight of the LORD, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but the LORD would not destroy the house of
David because of the covenant he had made with David and because of his promise
to give him and his sons a lamp for all time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>During his time Edom revolted against the
sovereignty of Judah; they chose a king of their own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereupon Jehoram crossed over with his
officers and all the chariots he had. He arose by night and broke through the
Edomites when they had surrounded him and the commanders of his chariots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>However, Edom has continued in revolt against
the sovereignty of Judah down to the present time. Libnah also revolted at that
time against Jehoram's sovereignty because he had forsaken the LORD, the God of
his fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also set up high places in the mountains of
Judah; he led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into idolatry and seduced Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WS href="__PB5.HTM#$WS">2</a></sup></font></sup> He received a letter from the prophet Elijah
with this message: &quot;Thus says the LORD, the God of your ancestor David:
'Because you have not followed the path of your father Jehoshaphat, nor of Asa,
king of Judah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>but instead have walked in the way of the kings
of Israel and have led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem into idolatry, as
did the house of Ahab, and also because you have murdered your brothers of your
father's house who were better than you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the LORD will strike your people, your
children, your wives, and all that is yours with a great plague; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and you shall have severe pains from a disease
in your bowels, while your bowels issue forth because of the disease, day after
day.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the
animosity of the Philistines and of the Arabs who bordered on the Ethiopians. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They came up against Judah, invaded it, and
carried away all the wealth found in the king's palace, along with his sons and
his wives; there was left to him only one son, Jehoahaz, his youngest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After these events, the LORD afflicted him with
an incurable disease of the bowels. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As time went on until a period of two years had
elapsed, his bowels issued forth because of the disease and he died in great
pain. His people did not made a pyre for him like that of his fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was thirty-two years old when he became
king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. He departed unloved and was
buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. </p>
