<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 29</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King David then said to the whole assembly:
&quot;My son Solomon, whom alone God has chosen, is still young and immature;
the work, however, is great, for this castle is not intended for man, but for
the LORD God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For this reason I have stored up for the house
of my God, as far as I was able, gold for what will be made of gold, silver for
what will be made of silver, bronze for what will be made of bronze, iron for
what will be made of iron, wood for what will be made of wood, onyx stones and
settings for them, carnelian and mosaic stones, every other kind of precious
stone, and great quantities of marble. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now, because of the delight I take in the
house of my God, in addition to all that I stored up for the holy house, I give
to the house of my God my personal fortune in gold and silver: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>three thousand talents of Ophir gold, and seven
thousand talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the rooms, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for the various utensils to be made of gold and
silver, and for every work that is to be done by artisans. Now, who else is
willing to contribute generously this day to the LORD?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the heads of the families, the leaders of
the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the
overseers of the king's affairs came forward willingly </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and contributed for the service of the house of
God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents
of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand
talents of iron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Those who had precious stones gave them into
the keeping of Jehiel the Gershonite for the treasury of the house of the LORD.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The people rejoiced over these free-will
offerings, which had been contributed to the LORD wholeheartedly. King David
also rejoiced greatly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David blessed the LORD in the presence of
the whole assembly, praying in these words: &quot;Blessed may you be, O LORD,
God of Israel our father, from eternity to eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Yours, O LORD, are grandeur and power,
majesty, splendor, and glory. For all in heaven and on earth is yours; yours, O
LORD, is the sovereignty; you are exalted as head over all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Riches and honor are from you, and you
have dominion over all. In your hand are power and might; it is yours to give
grandeur and strength to all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, our God, we give you thanks and we
praise the majesty of your name.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But who am I, and who are my people, that
we should have the means to contribute so freely? For everything is from you,
and we only give you what we have received from you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For we stand before you as aliens: we are only
your guests, like all our fathers. Our life on earth is like a shadow that does
not abide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>O LORD our God, all this wealth that we have
brought together to build you a house in honor of your holy name comes from you
and is entirely yours. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I know, O my God, that you put hearts to the
test and that you take pleasure in uprightness. With a sincere heart I have
willingly given all these things, and now with joy I have seen your people here
present also giving to you generously. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and
Israel, keep such thoughts in the hearts and minds of your people forever, and
direct their hearts toward you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Give to my son Solomon a wholehearted desire to
keep your commandments, precepts, and statutes, that he may carry out all these
plans and build the castle for which I have made preparation.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then David besought the whole assembly,
&quot;Now bless the LORD your God!&quot; And the whole assembly blessed the
LORD, the God of their fathers, bowing down and prostrating themselves before
the LORD and before the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the following day they offered sacrifices and
holocausts to the LORD, a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand
lambs, together with their libations and many other sacrifices for all Israel; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-VX href="__PAJ.HTM#$VX">1</a></sup></font></sup> and on that day they ate and drank in the
LORD'S presence with great rejoicing. Then for a second time they proclaimed
David's son Solomon king, and they anointed him as the LORD'S prince, and Zadok
as priest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thereafter Solomon sat on the throne of the
LORD as king in place of his father David; he prospered, and all Israel obeyed
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All the leaders and warriors, and also all the
other sons of King David, swore allegiance to King Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the LORD exalted Solomon greatly in the
eyes of all Israel, giving him a glorious reign such as had not been enjoyed by
any king over Israel before him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus David, the son of Jesse, had reigned over
all Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The time that he reigned over Israel was forty
years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem thirty-three. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He died at a ripe old age, rich in years and
wealth and glory, and his son Solomon succeeded him as king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now the deeds of King David, first and last,
can be found written in the history of Samuel the seer, the history of Nathan
the prophet, and the history of Gad the seer, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>together with the particulars of his reign and
valor, and of the events that affected him and all Israel and all the kingdoms
of the surrounding lands. </p>
