<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Once Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a harlot
and visited her. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Informed that Samson had come there, the men of
Gaza surrounded him with an ambush at the city gate all night long. And all the
night they waited, saying, &quot;Tomorrow morning we will kill him.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samson rested there until midnight. Then he
rose, seized the doors of the city gate and the two gateposts, and tore them
loose, bar and all. He hoisted them on his shoulders and carried them to the
top of the ridge opposite Hebron. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>After that he fell in love with a woman in the
Wadi Sorek whose name was Delilah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The lords of the Philistines came to her and
said, &quot;Beguile him and find out the secret of his great strength, and how
we may overcome and bind him so as to keep him helpless. We will each give you
eleven hundred shekels of silver.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Delilah said to Samson, &quot;Tell me the
secret of your great strength and how you may be bound so as to be kept
helpless.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If they bind me with seven fresh
bowstrings which have not dried,&quot; Samson answered her, &quot;I shall be as
weak as any other man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the lords of the Philistines brought her
seven fresh bowstrings which had not dried, and she bound him with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She had men lying in wait in the chamber and so
she said to him, &quot;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&quot; But he snapped
the strings as a thread of tow is severed by a whiff of flame; and the secret
of his strength remained unknown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Delilah said to Samson, &quot;You have mocked
me and told me lies. Now tell me how you may be bound.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;If they bind me tight with new ropes,
with which no work has been done,&quot; he answered her, &quot;I shall be as
weak as any other man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with
them. Then she said to him, &quot;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&quot;
For there were men lying in wait in the chamber. But he snapped them off his
arms like thread. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Delilah said to Samson again, &quot;Up to now
you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you may be bound.&quot; He
said to her, &quot;If you weave my seven locks of hair into the web and fasten
them with the pin, I shall be as weak as any other man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So while he slept, Delilah wove his seven locks
of hair into the web, and fastened them in with the pin. Then she said, &quot;The
Philistines are upon you, Samson!&quot; Awakening from his sleep, he pulled out
both the weaver's pin and the web. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then she said to him, &quot;How can you say
that you love me when you do not confide in me? Three times already you have
mocked me, and not told me the secret of your great strength!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She importuned him continually and vexed him
with her complaints till he was deathly weary of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he took her completely into his confidence
and told her, &quot;No razor has touched my head, for I have been consecrated
to God from my mother's womb. If I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I
shall be as weak as any other man.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Delilah saw that he had taken her
completely into his confidence, she summoned the lords of the Philistines,
saying, &quot;Come up this time, for he has opened his heart to me.&quot; So
the lords of the Philistines came and brought up the money with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>She had him sleep on her lap, and called for a
man who shaved off his seven locks of hair. Then she began to mistreat him, for
his strength had left him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When she said, &quot;The Philistines are upon
you, Samson!&quot;, and he woke from his sleep, he thought he could make good
his escape as he had done time and again, for he did not realize that the LORD
had left him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the Philistines seized him and gouged out
his eyes. Then they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze fetters,
and he was put to grinding in the prison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the hair of his head began to grow as soon
as it was shaved off. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-NI href="__P6J.HTM#$NI">1</a></sup></font></sup> The lords of the Philistines assembled to
offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon and to make merry. They said,<br>
&quot;Our god has delivered into our power<br>
Samson our enemy.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When their spirits were high, they said,
&quot;Call Samson that he may amuse us.&quot; So they called Samson from the
prison, and he played the buffoon before them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the people saw him, they praised their
god.<br>
For they said,<br>
&quot;Our god has delivered into our power<br>
our enemy, the ravager of our land,<br>
the one who has multiplied our slain.&quot;<br>
Then they stationed him between the columns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samson said to the attendant who was holding
his hand, &quot;Put me where I may touch the columns that support the temple
and may rest against them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The temple was full of men and women: all the
lords of the Philistines were there, and from the roof about three thousand men
and women looked on as Samson provided amusement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samson cried out to the LORD and said, &quot;O
Lord GOD, remember me! Strengthen me, O God, this last time that for my two
eyes I may avenge myself once and for all on the Philistines.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samson grasped the two middle columns on which
the temple rested and braced himself against them, one at his right hand, the
other at his left. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Samson said, &quot;Let me die with the
Philistines!&quot; He pushed hard, and the temple fell upon the lords and all
the people who were in it. Those he killed at his death were more than those he
had killed during his lifetime. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All his family and kinsmen went down and bore him
up for burial in the grave of his father Manoah between Zorah and Eshtaol. He
had judged Israel for twenty years. </p>
