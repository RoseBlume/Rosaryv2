<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RL href="__P8G.HTM#$RL">1</a></sup></font></sup> When the time of David's death drew near, he
gave these instructions to his son Solomon: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I am going the way of all mankind. Take
courage and be a man. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Keep the mandate of the LORD, your God,
following his ways and observing his statutes, commands, ordinances, and
decrees as they are written in the law of Moses, that you may succeed in
whatever you do, wherever you turn, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the LORD may fulfill the promise he made on
my behalf when he said, 'If your sons so conduct themselves that they remain
faithful to me with their whole heart and with their whole soul, you shall
always have someone of your line on the throne of Israel.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You yourself know what Joab, son of Zeruiah,
did to me when he slew the two generals of Israel's armies, Abner, son of Ner,
and Amasa, son of Jether. He took revenge for the blood of war in a time of
peace, and put bloodshed without provocation on the belt about my waist and the
sandal on my foot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Act with the wisdom you possess; you must not
allow him to go down to the grave in peaceful old age. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;But be kind to the sons of Barzillai the
Gileadite, and have them eat at your table. For they received me kindly when I
was fleeing your brother Absalom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You also have with you Shimei, son of
Gera, the Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me balefully when I was going to
Mahanaim. Because he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the
LORD that I would not put him to the sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you must not let him go unpunished. You are
a prudent man and will know how to deal with him to send down his hoary head in
blood to the grave.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David rested with his ancestors and was buried
in the City of David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The length of David's reign over Israel was
forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in
Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Solomon was seated on the throne of his
father David, with his sovereignty firmly established, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Adonijah, son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba,
the mother of Solomon. &quot;Do you come as a friend?&quot; she asked.
&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and added, &quot;I have something to say to
you.&quot; She replied, &quot;Say it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said: &quot;You know that the kingdom was
mine, and all Israel expected me to be king. But the kingdom escaped me and
became my brother's, for the LORD gave it to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now there is one favor I would ask of you.
Do not refuse me.&quot; And she said, &quot;Speak on.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RM href="__P8G.HTM#$RM">2</a></sup></font></sup> He said, &quot;Please ask King Solomon, who
will not refuse you, to give me Abishag the Shunamite for my wife.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Very well,&quot; replied Bathsheba,
&quot;I will speak to the king for you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to
him for Adonijah, and the king stood up to meet her and paid her homage. Then
he sat down upon his throne, and a throne was provided for the king's mother,
who sat at his right. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;There is one small favor I would ask of
you,&quot; she said. &quot;Do not refuse me.&quot; &quot;Ask it, my
mother,&quot; the king said to her, &quot;for I will not refuse you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So she said, &quot;Let Abishag the Shunamite be
given to your brother Adonijah for his wife.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;And why do you ask Abishag the Shunamite
for Adonijah?&quot; King Solomon answered his mother. &quot;Ask the kingdom for
him as well, for he is my elder brother and has with him Abiathar the priest
and Joab, son of Zeruiah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And King Solomon swore by the LORD: &quot;May
God do thus and so to me, and more besides, if Adonijah has not proposed this
at the cost of his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now, as the LORD lives, who has seated me
firmly on the throne of my father David and made of me a dynasty as he
promised, this day shall Adonijah be put to death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then King Solomon sent Benaiah, son of
Jehoiada, who struck him dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king said to Abiathar the priest: &quot;Go
to your land in Anathoth. Though you deserve to die, I will not put you to
death this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father
David and shared in all the hardships my father endured.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Solomon deposed Abiathar from his office of
priest of the LORD, thus fulfilling the prophecy which the LORD had made in
Shiloh about the house of Eli. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the news came to Joab, who had sided with
Adonijah, though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and seized
the horns of the altar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the
tent of the LORD and was at the altar. He sent Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, with
the order, &quot;Go, strike him down.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Benaiah went to the tent of the LORD and said
to him, &quot;The king says, 'Come out.'&quot; But he answered, &quot;No! I
will die here.&quot; Benaiah reported to the king, &quot;This is what Joab said
to me in reply.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king answered him: &quot;Do as he has said,
Strike him down and bury him, and you will remove from me and from my family
the blood which Joab shed without provocation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The LORD will hold him responsible for his own
blood, because he struck down two men better and more just than himself, and
slew them with the sword without my father David's knowledge: Abner, son of
Ner, general of Israel's army, and Amasa, son of Jether, general of Judah's
army. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab and his descendants shall be responsible
forever for their blood. But there shall be the peace of the LORD forever for
David, and his descendants, and his house, and his throne.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, went back, struck him
down and killed him; he was buried in his house in the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king appointed Benaiah, son of Jehoiada,
over the army in his place, and put Zadok the priest in place of Abiathar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him:
&quot;Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there. Do not go anywhere
else. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For if you leave, and cross the Kidron Valley,
be certain you shall die without fail. You shall be responsible for your own
blood.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Shimei answered the king: &quot;I accept. Your
servant will do just as the king's majesty has said.&quot; So Shimei stayed in
Jerusalem for a long time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But three years later, two of Shimei's servants
ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was informed that
his servants were in Gath. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So Shimei rose, saddled his ass, and went to
Achish in Gath in search of his servants, whom he brought back. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Solomon was informed that Shimei had gone
from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the king summoned Shimei and said to him:
&quot;Did I not have you swear by the LORD to your clear understanding of my
warning that, if you left and went anywhere else, you should die without fail?
And you answered, 'I accept and obey.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why, then, have you not kept the oath of the
LORD and the command that I gave you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And the king said to Shimei: &quot;You know in
your heart the evil that you did to my father David. Now the LORD requites you
for your own wickedness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But King Solomon shall be blessed, and David's
throne shall endure before the LORD forever.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then gave the order to Benaiah, son of
Jehoiada, who struck him dead as he left. </p>
