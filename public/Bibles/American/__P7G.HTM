<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 22</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David left Gath and escaped to the cave of
Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of his family heard about it, they came
down to him there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was joined by all those who were in
difficulties or in debt, or who were embittered, and he became their leader.
About four hundred men were with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab and
said to the king of Moab, &quot;Let my father and mother stay with you, until I
learn what God will do for me.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-Q4 href="__P7G.HTM#$Q4">1</a></sup></font></sup> He left them with the king of Moab, and they
stayed with him as long as David remained in the refuge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the prophet Gad said to David: &quot;Do not
remain in the refuge. Leave, and go to the land of Judah.&quot; And so David
left and went to the forest of Hereth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now Saul heard that David and his men had been
located. At the time he was sitting in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree on the high
place, holding his spear, while all his servants were standing by. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said to them: &quot;Listen, men of
Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he
make each of you an officer over a thousand or a hundred men, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that you have all conspired against me and no
one tells me that my son has made an agreement with the son of Jesse? None of
you shows sympathy for me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my
servant to be an enemy against me, as is the case today.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with
the officers of Saul, spoke up: &quot;I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech,
son of Ahitub, in Nob. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He consulted the LORD for him and gave him
supplies, and the sword of Goliath the Philistine as well.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this the king sent a summons to Ahimelech
the priest, son of Ahitub, and to all his family who were priests in Nob; and
they all came to the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Saul said, &quot;Listen, son of
Ahitub!&quot; He replied, &quot;Yes, my lord.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul asked him, &quot;Why did you conspire
against me with the son of Jesse by giving him food and a sword and by
consulting God for him, that he might rebel against me and become my enemy, as
is the case today?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ahimelech answered the king: &quot;And who
among all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of
your bodyguard, and honored in your own house? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Is this the first time I have consulted God for
him? No indeed! Let not the king accuse his servant or anyone in my family of
such a thing. Your servant knows nothing at all, great or small, about the
whole matter.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king said, &quot;You shall die,
Ahimelech, with all your family.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then commanded his henchmen standing
by: &quot;Make the rounds and kill the priests of the LORD, for they assisted
David. They knew he was a fugitive and yet failed to inform me.&quot; But the
king's servants refused to lift a hand to strike the priests of the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king therefore commanded Doeg, &quot;You
make the rounds and kill the priests!&quot; So Doeg the Edomite went from one
to the next and killed the priests himself, slaying on that day eighty-five who
wore the linen ephod. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Saul also put the priestly city of Nob to the
sword, including men and women, children and infants, and oxen, asses and
sheep. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>One son of Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, named
Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Abiathar told David that Saul had slain
the priests of the LORD, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>David said to him: &quot;I knew that day, when
Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I am responsible
for the death of all your family. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Stay with me. Fear nothing; he that seeks your
life must seek my life also. You are under my protection.&quot; </p>
