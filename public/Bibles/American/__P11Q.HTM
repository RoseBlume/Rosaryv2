<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should

faith. </p>

people and events of the Old Testament to paint an inspiring portrait of
religious faith, firm and unyielding in the face of any obstacles that confront
it. These pages rank among the most eloquent and lofty to be found in the
Bible. They expand the theme announced in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11L.HTM#NTLET.HEB.6.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews
6:12, to which the author now returns (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11P.HTM#NTLET.HEB.10.39"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews
10:39). The material of this chapter is developed chronologically.
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:3-7 draw upon the first nine chapters
of Genesis (Genesis 1-9); <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:8-22, upon
the period of the patriarchs; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.23"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:23-31,
upon the time of Moses; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.32"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:32-38, upon
the history of the judges, the prophets, and the Maccabean martyrs. The author
gives the most extensive description of faith provided in the New Testament,
though his interest does not lie in a technical, theological definition. In
view of the needs of his audience he describes what authentic faith does, not
what it is in itself. Through faith God guarantees the blessings to be hoped
for from him, providing evidence in the gift of faith that what he promises
will eventually come to pass (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:1).
Because they accepted in faith God's guarantee of the future, the biblical
personages discussed in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:3-38 were
themselves commended by God (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:2).
Christians have even greater reason to remain firm in faith since they, unlike
the Old Testament men and women of faith, have perceived the beginning of God's
fulfillment of his messianic promises (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11Q.HTM#NTLET.HEB.11.39"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 11:39-40).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VB href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VB">2</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [1] Faith is the realization . . .
evidence: the author is not attempting a precise definition. There is dispute
about the meaning of the Greek words hypostasis and elenchos, here translated
realization and evidence, respectively. Hypostasis usually means
&quot;substance,&quot; &quot;being&quot; (as translated in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11G.HTM#NTLET.HEB.1.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 1:3), or &quot;reality&quot; (as translated
in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11I.HTM#NTLET.HEB.3.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 3:14); here it connotes something more
subjective, and so realization has been chosen rather than
&quot;assurance&quot; (RSV). Elenchos, usually &quot;proof,&quot; is used here
in an objective sense and so translated evidence rather than the transferred
sense of &quot;(inner) conviction&quot; (RSV). </p>

does not speak of the faith of the Old Testament men and women but is in the
first person plural. Hence it seems out of place in the sequence of thought.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VD href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VD">4</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [4] The &quot;Praise of the
Ancestors&quot; in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNA.HTM#WISDB.SIR.44.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Sirach
44:1-<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PNG.HTM#WISDB.SIR.50.21"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 50:21 gives a similar list of
heroes. The Cain and Abel narrative in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P6.HTM#PENT.GEN.4.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
4:1-16 does not mention Abel's faith. It says, however, that God
&quot;looked with favor on Abel and his offering&quot; (Genesis 4, 4); in view
of v 6 the author probably understood God's favor to have been activated by
Abel's faith. Though dead, he still speaks: possibly because his blood
&quot;cries out to me from the soil&quot; (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P6.HTM#PENT.GEN.4.10"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Genesis
4:10), but more probably a way of saying that the repeated story of
Abel provides ongoing witness to faith.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VE href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VE">5</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [6] One must believe not only that
God exists but that he is concerned about human conduct; the Old Testament
defines folly as the denial of this truth; cf <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PH8.HTM#WISDB.PSA.52.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Psalm 52:2.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VF href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VF">6</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [19] As a symbol: Isaac's
&quot;return from death&quot; is seen as a symbol of Christ's resurrection.
Others understand the words en parabole to mean &quot;in figure,&quot; i.e.,
the word dead is used figuratively of Isaac, since he did not really die. But
in the one other place that parabole occurs in Hebrews, it means symbol
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P11O.HTM#NTLET.HEB.9.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Hebrews 9:9).</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VG href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VG">7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [20-22] Each of these three
patriarchs, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, had faith in the future fulfillment of
God's promise and renewed this faith when near death.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VH href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VH">8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [24-27] The reason given for Moses'
departure from Egypt differs from the account in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_P1J.HTM#PENT.EXO.2.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Exodus
2:11-15. The author also gives a christological interpretation of his
decision to share the trials of his people.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$4VI href="__P11Q.HTM#-4VI">9</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [40] So that without us they should
not be made perfect: the heroes of the Old Testament obtained their recompense
only after the saving work of Christ had been accomplished. Thus they already
enjoy what Christians who are still struggling do not yet possess in its
fullness.</p>
