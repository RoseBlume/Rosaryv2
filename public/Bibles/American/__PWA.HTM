similarity of structure and themes but dissimilarity of detail are considered
by many to refer to a single event that, however, developed in two distinct

<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PXE.HTM#GOSP.JOH.6.30"><b>&#8658;</b></A> John 6:30-31. Jesus' response shows that a sign

point in Mark's account of Jesus in his public ministry. Popular opinions
concur in regarding him as a prophet. The disciples by contrast believe him to
be the Messiah. Jesus acknowledges this identification but prohibits them from
making his messianic office known to avoid confusing it with ambiguous
contemporary ideas on the nature of that office. See further the notes on
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVP.HTM#GOSP.MAT.16.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 16:13-20.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3F0 href="__PWA.HTM#-3F0">7</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [31] Son of Man: an enigmatic
title. It is used in <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PSS.HTM#PROPHB.DAN.7.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Daniel 7:13-14 has a symbol
of &quot;the saints of the Most High,&quot; the faithful Israelites who receive
the everlasting kingdom from the Ancient One (God). They are represented by a
human figure that contrasts with the various beasts who represent the previous
kingdoms of the earth. In the Jewish apocryphal books of 1 Enoch and 4 Ezra the
&quot;Son of Man&quot; is not, as in Daniel, a group, but a unique figure of
extraordinary spiritual endowments, who will be revealed as the one through
whom the everlasting kingdom decreed by God will be established. It is possible
though doubtful that this individualization of the Son of Man figure had been
made in Jesus' time, and therefore his use of the title in that sense is
questionable. Of itself, this expression means simply a human being, or,
indefinitely, someone, and there are evidences of this use in pre-Christian
times. Its use in the New Testament is probably due to Jesus' speaking of
himself in that way, &quot;a human being,&quot; and the later church's taking
this in the sense of the Jewish apocrypha and applying it to him with that
meaning. Rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes: the
supreme council called the Sanhedrin was made up of seventy-one members of
these three groups and presided over by the high priest. It exercised authority
over the Jews in religious matters. See the note on <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVH.HTM#GOSP.MAT.8.20"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew
8:20.</p>

<p><sup></sup></p><br><br></font><font size=3><b><a name=$3F1 href="__PWA.HTM#-3F1">8</a></b></font><font face=Verdana size=1><sup></sup> [34-35] This utterance of Jesus
challenges all believers to authentic discipleship and total commitment to
himself through self-renunciation and acceptance of the cross of suffering,
even to the sacrifice of life itself. Whoever wishes to save his life will lose
it . . . will save it: an expression of the ambivalence of life and its
contrasting destiny. Life seen as mere self-centered earthly existence and
lived in denial of Christ ends in destruction, but when lived in loyalty to
Christ, despite earthly death, it arrives at fullness of life.</p>
