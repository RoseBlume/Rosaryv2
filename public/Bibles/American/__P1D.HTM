<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 47</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph went and told Pharaoh, &quot;My father
and my brothers have come from the land of Canaan, with their flocks and herds
and everything else they own; and they are now in the region of Goshen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He then presented to Pharaoh five of his
brothers whom he had selected from their full number. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Pharaoh asked them what their occupation
was, they answered, &quot;We, your servants, like our ancestors, are shepherds.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>We have come,&quot; they continued, &quot;in
order to stay in this country, for there is no pasture for your servants'
flocks in the land of Canaan, so severe has the famine been there. Please,
therefore, let your servants settle in the region of Goshen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;They may settle
in the region of Goshen; and if you know any of them to be qualified, you may
put them in charge of my own livestock.&quot; Thus, when Jacob and his sons
came to Joseph in Egypt, and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, heard about it, Pharaoh
said to Joseph, &quot;Now that your father and brothers have come to you, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle
your father and brothers in the pick of the land.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Joseph brought his father Jacob and
presented him to Pharaoh. After Jacob had paid his respects to Pharaoh, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Pharaoh asked him, &quot;How many years have
you lived?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6J href="__P1D.HTM#$6J">1</a></sup></font></sup> Jacob replied: &quot;The years I have lived as
a wayfarer amount to a hundred and thirty. Few and hard have been these years
of my life, and they do not compare with the years that my ancestors lived as
wayfarers.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then Jacob bade Pharaoh farewell and withdrew
from his presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6K href="__P1D.HTM#$6K">2</a></sup></font></sup> As Pharaoh had ordered, Joseph settled his
father and brothers and gave them holdings in Egypt on the pick of the land, in
the region of Rameses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And Joseph sustained his father and brothers
and his father's whole household, down to the youngest, with food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since there was no food in any country because
of the extreme severity of the famine, and the lands of Egypt and Canaan were
languishing from hunger, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph gathered in, as payment for the rations
that were being dispensed, all the money that was to be found in Egypt and
Canaan, and he put it in Pharaoh's palace. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was
spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, pleading, &quot;Give us food or we
shall perish under your eyes; for our money is gone.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Since your money is gone,&quot; replied
Joseph, &quot;give me your livestock, and I will sell you bread in return for
your livestock.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and
he sold them food in return for their horses, their flocks of sheep and herds
of cattle, and their donkeys. Thus he got them through that year with bread in
exchange for all their livestock. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When that year ended, they came to him in the
following one and said: &quot;We cannot hide from my lord that, with our money
spent and our livestock made over to my lord, there is nothing left to put at
my lord's disposal except our bodies and our farm land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Why should we and our land perish before your
very eyes? Take us and our land in exchange for food, and we will become
Pharaoh's slaves and our land his property; only give us seed, that we may
survive and not perish, and that our land may not turn into a waste.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Joseph acquired all the farm land of Egypt
for Pharaoh, since with the famine too much for them to bear, every Egyptian
sold his field; so the land passed over to Pharaoh, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and the people were reduced to slavery, from
one end of Egypt's territory to the other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only the priests' lands Joseph did not take
over. Since the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived off the
allowance Pharaoh had granted them, they did not have to sell their land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joseph told the people: &quot;Now that I have
acquired you and your land for Pharaoh, here is your seed for sowing the land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when the harvest is in, you must give a
fifth of it to Pharaoh, while you keep four-fifths as seed for your fields and
as food for yourselves and your families (and as food for your children).&quot;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;You have saved our lives!&quot; they answered.
&quot;We are grateful to my lord that we can be Pharaoh's slaves.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Joseph made it a law for the land in
Egypt, which is still in force, that a fifth of its produce should go to
Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not pass over to Pharaoh. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in
the region of Goshen. There they acquired property, were fertile, and increased
greatly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen
years; the span of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the time approached for Israel to die, he
called his son Joseph and said to him: &quot;If you really wish to please me,
put your hand under my thigh as a sign of your constant loyalty to me; do not
let me be buried in Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I lie down with my ancestors, have me
taken out of Egypt and buried in their burial place.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-6L href="__P1D.HTM#$6L">3</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;I will do as you say,&quot; he replied.
But his father demanded, &quot;Swear it to me!&quot; So Joseph swore to him.
Then Israel bowed at the head of the bed. </p>
