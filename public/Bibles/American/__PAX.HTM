<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 13</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah
became king of Judah; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother
was named Michaiah, daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah
and Jeroboam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abijah joined battle with a force of four
hundred thousand picked warriors, while Jeroboam lined up against him in battle
with eight hundred thousand picked and valiant warriors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-WG href="__PAX.HTM#$WG">1</a></sup></font></sup> Abijah stood on Mount Zemariam, which is in
the highlands of Ephraim, and said: &quot;Listen to me, Jeroboam and all
Israel! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Do you not know that the LORD, the God of
Israel, has given the kingdom of Israel to David forever, to him and to his
sons, by a covenant made in salt? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet Jeroboam, son of Nebat, the servant of
Solomon, son of David, has stood up and rebelled against his lord! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Worthless men, scoundrels, joined him and
overcame Rehoboam, son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and unthinking, and
no match for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But now, do you think you are a match for the
kingdom of the LORD commanded by the sons of David, simply because you are a
huge multitude and have with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for
gods? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Have you not expelled the priests of the
LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests like
the peoples of foreign lands? Everyone who comes to consecrate himself with a
young bull and seven rams becomes a priest of no-gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have
not forsaken him. The priests ministering to the LORD are sons of Aaron, and
the Levites also have their offices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They burn holocausts to the LORD and fragrant
incense morning after morning and evening after evening; they display the
showbread on the pure table, and the lamps of the golden lampstand burn evening
after evening; for we observe our duties to the LORD, our God, but you have
abandoned him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See, God is with us, at our head, and his
priests are here with trumpets to sound the attack against you. Do not battle
against the LORD, the God of your fathers, O Israelites, for you will not
succeed!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Jeroboam had an ambush go around them to
come at them from the rear; so that while his army faced Judah, his ambush lay
behind them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Judah turned and saw that they had to
battle on both fronts, they cried out to the LORD and the priests sounded the
trumpets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the men of Judah shouted; and when they
did so, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites fled before Judah, and God
delivered them into their hands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abijah and his people inflicted a severe defeat
upon them; five hundred thousand picked men of Israel fell slain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The Israelites were subdued on that occasion
and the Judahites were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of
their fathers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from
him: Bethel and its dependencies, Jeshanah and its dependencies, and Ephron and
its dependencies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Jeroboam did not regain power during the time
of Abijah; the LORD struck him down and he died, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>while Abijah continued to grow stronger. He
took to himself fourteen wives and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen
daughters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The rest of Abijah's acts, his deeds and his
words, are written in the midrash of the prophet Iddo. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Abijah rested with his ancestors; they buried
him in the City of David. His son Asa succeeded him as king. During his time,
ten years of peace began in the land. </p>
