<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44R href="__PYG.HTM#$44R">1</a></sup></font></sup> &quot;My brothers and fathers, listen to what
I am about to say to you in my defense.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they heard him addressing them in Hebrew
they became all the more quiet. And he continued, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia,
but brought up in this city. At the feet of Gamaliel I was educated strictly in
our ancestral law and was zealous for God, just as all of you are today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I persecuted this Way to death, binding both
men and women and delivering them to prison. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Even the high priest and the whole council of
elders can testify on my behalf. For from them I even received letters to the
brothers and set out for Damascus to bring back to Jerusalem in chains for
punishment those there as well. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;On that journey as I drew near to
Damascus, about noon a great light from the sky suddenly shone around me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying
to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I replied, 'Who are you, sir?' And he said to me,
'I am Jesus the Nazorean whom you are persecuting.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>My companions saw the light but did not hear
the voice of the one who spoke to me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I asked, 'What shall I do, sir?' The Lord
answered me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about
everything appointed for you to do.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Since I could see nothing because of the
brightness of that light, I was led by hand by my companions and entered
Damascus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;A certain Ananias, a devout observer of
the law, and highly spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>came to me and stood there and said, 'Saul, my
brother, regain your sight.' And at that very moment I regained my sight and
saw him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said, 'The God of our ancestors
designated you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the
sound of his voice; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for you will be his witness <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44S href="__PYG.HTM#$44S">2</a></sup></font></sup>
before all to what you have seen and heard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now, why delay? Get up and have yourself
baptized and your sins washed away, calling upon his name.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;After I had returned to Jerusalem and
while I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and saw the Lord saying to me, 'Hurry, leave
Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But I replied, 'Lord, they themselves know that
from synagogue to synagogue I used to imprison and beat those who believed in
you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And when the blood of your witness Stephen was
being shed, I myself stood by giving my approval and keeping guard over the
cloaks of his murderers.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he said to me, 'Go, I shall send you far
away to the Gentiles.'&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44T href="__PYG.HTM#$44T">3</a></sup></font></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They listened to him until he said this, but
then they raised their voices and shouted, &quot;Take such a one as this away
from the earth. It is not right that he should live.&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44U href="__PYG.HTM#$44U">4</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And as they were yelling and throwing off their
cloaks and flinging dust into the air, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the cohort commander ordered him to be brought
into the compound and gave instruction that he be interrogated under the lash to
determine the reason why they were making such an outcry against him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when they had stretched him out for the
whips, Paul said to the centurion on duty, &quot;Is it lawful for you to
scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and has not been tried?&quot; <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-44V href="__PYG.HTM#$44V">5</a></sup></font></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When the centurion heard this, he went to the
cohort commander and reported it, saying, &quot;What are you going to do? This
man is a Roman citizen.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the commander came and said to him,
&quot;Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The commander replied, &quot;I acquired this
citizenship for a large sum of money.&quot; Paul said, &quot;But I was born
one.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At once those who were going to interrogate him
backed away from him, and the commander became alarmed when he realized that he
was a Roman citizen and that he had had him bound. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The next day, wishing to determine the truth
about why he was being accused by the Jews, he freed him and ordered the chief
priests and the whole Sanhedrin to convene. Then he brought Paul down and made
him stand before them. </p>

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYG.HTM#GOSP.ACT.22.3"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 22:3) and zealous persecutor of the
Christian community (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PYG.HTM#GOSP.ACT.22.4"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Acts 22:4-5), and then
