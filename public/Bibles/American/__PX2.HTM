through the town. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now a man there named Zacchaeus, who was a chief
tax collector and also a wealthy man, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>was seeking to see who Jesus was; but he could
not see him because of the crowd, for he was short in stature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in
order to see Jesus, who was about to pass that way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he reached the place, Jesus looked up and
said to him, &quot;Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your
house.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And he came down quickly and received him with
joy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When they all saw this, they began to grumble,
saying, &quot;He has gone to stay at the house of a sinner.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord,
&quot;Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I
have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3O3 href="__PX2.HTM#$3O3">2</a></sup></font></sup> And Jesus said to him, &quot;Today salvation

the kingdom of God would appear there immediately. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So he said, &quot;A nobleman went off to a
distant country to obtain the kingship for himself and then to return. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He called ten of his servants and gave them ten
gold coins <sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3O6 href="__PX2.HTM#$3O6">5</a></sup></font></sup> and told them, 'Engage in trade with these
until I return.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His fellow citizens, however, despised him and
sent a delegation after him to announce, 'We do not want this man to be our
king.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But when he returned after obtaining the kingship,
he had the servants called, to whom he had given the money, to learn what they
had gained by trading. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The first came forward and said, 'Sir, your
gold coin has earned ten additional ones.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He replied, 'Well done, good servant! You have
been faithful in this very small matter; take charge of ten cities.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the second came and reported, 'Your gold
coin, sir, has earned five more.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And to this servant too he said, 'You, take
charge of five cities.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the other servant came and said, 'Sir,
here is your gold coin; I kept it stored away in a handkerchief, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>for I was afraid of you, because you are a
demanding person; you take up what you did not lay down and you harvest what
you did not plant.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said to him, 'With your own words I shall
condemn you, you wicked servant. You knew I was a demanding person, taking up
what I did not lay down and harvesting what I did not plant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on
my return I would have collected it with interest.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And to those standing by he said, 'Take the
gold coin from him and give it to the servant who has ten.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But they said to him, 'Sir, he has ten gold
coins.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>'I tell you, to everyone who has, more will be
given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Now as for those enemies of mine who did not
want me as their king, bring them here and slay them before me.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3O7 href="__PX2.HTM#$3O7">6</a></sup></font></sup> After he had said this, he proceeded on his
journey up to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the
place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He said, &quot;Go into the village opposite
you, and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever
sat. Untie it and bring it here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And if anyone should ask you, 'Why are you
untying it?' you will answer, 'The Master has need of it.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So those who had been sent went off and found
everything just as he had told them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And as they were untying the colt, its owners
said to them, &quot;Why are you untying this colt?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They answered, &quot;The Master has need of
it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks
over the colt, and helped Jesus to mount. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As he rode along, the people were spreading
their cloaks on the road; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and now as he was approaching the slope of the
Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of his disciples began to praise God aloud
with joy for all the mighty deeds they had seen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They proclaimed: &quot;Blessed is the king who

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him,

<p class=MsoNormal>40

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-3OA href="__PX2.HTM#$3OA">9</a></sup></font></sup> As he drew near, he saw the city and wept over

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.2"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 19:2), Zacchaeus provides a contrast to the
rich man of <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX1.HTM#GOSP.LUK.18.18"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 18:18-23 who cannot detach
himself from his material possessions to become a follower of Jesus. Zacchaeus,
according to Luke, exemplifies the proper attitude toward wealth: he promises
to give half of his possessions to the poor (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.8"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.9"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 19:9-10). </p>

literally, &quot;a son of Abraham.&quot; The tax collector Zacchaeus, whose
repentance is attested by his determination to amend his former ways, shows
himself to be a true descendant of Abraham, the true heir to the promises of
God in the Old Testament. Underlying Luke's depiction of Zacchaeus as a
descendant of Abraham, the father of the Jews (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWK.HTM#GOSP.LUK.1.73"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke

combined two originally distinct parables: (1) a parable about the conduct of
faithful and productive servants (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.13"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 19:13,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.15"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 15b-26) and (2) a parable about a rejected king
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.12"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 19:12,
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 14-15a, <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.27"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 27). The
story about the conduct of servants occurs in another form in
<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PVY.HTM#GOSP.MAT.25.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Matthew 25:14-20. The story about the rejected
king may have originated with a contemporary historical event. After the death
of Herod the Great, his son Archelaus traveled to Rome to receive the title of
king. A delegation of Jews appeared in Rome before Caesar Augustus to oppose
the request of Archelaus. Although not given the title of king, Archelaus was
made ruler over Judea and Samaria. As the story is used by Luke, however, it
furnishes a correction to the expectation of the imminent end of the age and of
the establishment of the kingdom in Jerusalem (<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.11"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke
19:11). Jesus is not on his way to Jerusalem to receive the kingly power;
for that, he must go away and only after returning from the distant country (a
reference to the parousia) will reward and judgment take place.</p>

the royal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, a new section of Luke's gospel begins,
the ministry of Jesus in Jerusalem before his death and resurrection. Luke
suggests that this was a lengthy ministry in Jerusalem
(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX2.HTM#GOSP.LUK.19.47"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 19:47; <A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX3.HTM#GOSP.LUK.20.1"><b>&#8658;</b></A> 20:1;

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PX4.HTM#GOSP.LUK.21.37"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 21:37-38). For the story of the entry of

(<A href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_PWL.HTM#GOSP.LUK.2.14"><b>&#8658;</b></A> Luke 2:14). The peace Jesus brings is associated
