<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2KG href="__PS3.HTM#$2KG">1</a></sup></font></sup> On the first day of the third month in the
eleventh year, the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Son of man, say to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt,
and to his hordes: What are you like in your greatness? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Behold, a cypress (cedar) in Lebanon, beautiful
of branch, lofty of stature, amid the very clouds lifted its crest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Waters made it grow, the abyss made it
flourish, sending its rivers round where it was planted, turning its streams to
all the trees of the field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus it grew taller than every other tree of
the field, and longer of branch because of the abundant water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In its boughs nested all the birds of the air,
under its branches all beasts of the field gave birth, in its shade dwelt
numerous peoples of every race. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It became beautiful and stately in its spread
of foliage, for its roots were turned toward abundant water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The cedars in the garden of God were not its
equal, nor could the fir trees match its boughs, Neither were the plane trees
like it for branches; no tree in the garden of God matched its beauty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I made it beautiful, with much foliage, the
envy of all Eden's trees in the garden of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it
became lofty in stature, raising its crest among the clouds, and because it
became proud in heart at its height, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I have handed it over to the mightiest of the
nations, which has dealt with it in keeping with its wickedness. I humiliated
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Foreigners, the most ruthless of the nations,
cut it down and left it on the mountains. Its foliage was brought low in all
the valleys, its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land, and all
the peoples of the land withdrew from its shade, abandoning it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On its fallen trunk rested all the birds of the
air, and by its branches were all the beasts of the field. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus no tree may grow lofty in stature or raise
its crest among the clouds; no tree fed by water may stand by itself in its
loftiness. For all of them are destined for death, for the land below, For the
company of mortals, those who go down into the pit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day he went down
to the nether world I made the abyss close up over him; I stopped its streams
so that the deep waters were held back. I cast gloom over Lebanon because of
him, so that all the trees in the land drooped on his account. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At the crash of his fall I made the nations
rock, when I cast him down to the nether world with those who go down into the
pit. In the land below, all Eden's trees were consoled, Lebanon's choice and
best, all that were fed by water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They too have come down with him to the nether
world, to those slain by the sword; those who dwelt in his shade are dispersed
among the nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Which was your equal in glory or size among the
trees of Eden? Yet you have been brought down with the trees of Eden to the
land below. You shall lie with the uncircumcised, with those slain by the
sword. Such are Pharaoh and all his hordes, says the Lord GOD. </p>
