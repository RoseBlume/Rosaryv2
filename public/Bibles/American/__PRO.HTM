<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the word of the LORD came to me: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her
abominations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2IX href="__PRO.HTM#$2IX">1</a></sup></font></sup> Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: By origin
and birth you are of the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your
mother a Hittite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As for your birth, the day you were born your
navel cord was not cut; you were neither washed with water nor anointed, nor
were you rubbed with salt, nor swathed in swaddling clothes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>No one looked on you with pity or compassion to
do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out on the ground as
something loathsome, the day you were born. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I passed by and saw you weltering in your
blood. I said to you: Live in your blood </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>and grow like a plant in the field. You grew
and developed, you came to the age of puberty; your breasts were formed, your
hair had grown, but you were still stark naked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2IY href="__PRO.HTM#$2IY">2</a></sup></font></sup> Again I passed by you and saw that you were
now old enough for love. So I spread the corner of my cloak over you to cover
your nakedness; I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you;
you became mine, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then I bathed you with water, washed away your
blood, and anointed you with oil. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I clothed you with an embroidered gown, put
sandals of fine leather on your feet; I gave you a fine linen sash and silk
robes to wear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on
your arms, a necklace about your neck, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a ring in your nose, pendants in your ears, and
a glorious diadem upon your head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus you were adorned with gold and silver;
your garments were of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. Fine flour,
honey, and oil were your food. You were exceedingly beautiful, with the dignity
of a queen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You were renowned among the nations for your
beauty, perfect as it was, because of my splendor which I had bestowed on you,
says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But you were captivated by your own beauty, you
used your renown to make yourself a harlot, and you lavished your harlotry on
every passer-by, whose own you became. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2IZ href="__PRO.HTM#$2IZ">3</a></sup></font></sup> You took some of your gowns and made for
yourself gaudy high places, where you played the harlot. . . . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You took the splendid gold and silver ornaments
that I had given you and made for yourself male images, with which also you
played the harlot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You took your embroidered gowns to cover them;
my oil and my incense you set before them; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the food that I had given you, the fine flour,
the oil, and the honey with which I fed you, you set before them as an
appeasing odor, says the Lord GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2J0 href="__PRO.HTM#$2J0">4</a></sup></font></sup> The sons and daughters you had borne me you
took and offered as sacrifices to be devoured by them! Was it not enough that
you had become a harlot? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You slaughtered and immolated my children to
them, making them pass through fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And through all your abominations and
harlotries you remembered nothing of when you were a girl, stark naked and
weltering in your blood. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then after all your evildoing - woe, woe to
you! says the Lord GOD -&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2J1 href="__PRO.HTM#$2J1">5</a></sup></font></sup> you raised for yourself a platform and a dais
in every public place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At every street corner you built a dais for
yourself to use your beauty obscenely, spreading your legs for every passer-by,
playing the harlot countless times. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You played the harlot with the Egyptians, your
lustful neighbors, so many times that I was provoked to anger. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore I stretched out my hand against you, I
diminished your allowance and delivered you over to the will of your enemies,
the Philistines, who revolted at your lewd conduct. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You also played the harlot with the Assyrians,
because you were not satisfied; and after playing the harlot with them, you
were still not satisfied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Again and again you played the harlot, now
going to Chaldea, the land of the traders; but despite this, you were still not
satisfied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>How wild your lust! says the Lord GOD, that you
did all these things, acting like a shameless prostitute, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>building your platform at every street corner
and erecting your dais in every public place! Yet you were unlike a prostitute,
since you disdained payment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The adulterous wife receives, instead of her
husband, payment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All harlots receive gifts. But you rather
bestowed your gifts on all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from all
sides for your harlotry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus in your harlotry you were different from
all other women. No one sought you out for prostitution. Since you gave payment
instead of receiving it, how different you were! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Therefore, harlot, hear the word of the LORD! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus says the Lord GOD: Because you poured out
your lust and revealed your nakedness in your harlotry with your lovers and
abominable idols, and because you sacrificed the life-blood of your children to
them, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will now gather together all your lovers whom
you tried to please, whether you loved them or loved them not; I will gather
them against you from all sides and expose you naked for them to see. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will inflict on you the sentence of adulteresses
and murderesses; I will wreak fury and jealousy upon you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will hand you over to them to tear down your
platform and demolish your dais; they shall strip you of your garments and take
away your splendid ornaments, leaving you stark naked. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall lead an assembly against you to
stone you and hack you with their swords. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>They shall burn your apartments with fire and inflict
punishments on you while many women look on. Thus I will put an end to your
harlotry, and you shall never again give payment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When I have wreaked my fury upon you I will
cease to be jealous of you, I will be quiet and no longer vexed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Because you did not remember what happened when
you were a girl, but enraged me with all these things, therefore in return I am
bringing down your conduct upon your head, says the Lord GOD. For did you not
add lewdness to the rest of your abominable deeds? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>See, everyone who is fond of proverbs will say
of you, 'Like mother, like daughter.' </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2J2 href="__PRO.HTM#$2J2">6</a></sup></font></sup> Yes, you are the true daughter of the mother
who spurned her husband and children, and you are a true sister to those who
spurned their husbands and children - your mother was a Hittite and your father
an Amorite. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-2J3 href="__PRO.HTM#$2J3">7</a></sup></font></sup> Your elder sister was Samaria with her
daughters, living to the north of you; and your younger sister, living to the
south of you, was Sodom with her daughters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet not only in their ways did you walk, and
act as abominably as they did; in a very short time you became more corrupt in
all your ways than they. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>As I live, says the Lord GOD, I swear that your
sister Sodom, with her daughters, has not done as you and your daughters have
done! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And look at the guilt of your sister Sodom: she
and her daughters were proud, sated with food, complacent in their prosperity,
and they gave no help to the poor and needy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Rather, they became haughty and committed
abominable crimes in my presence; then, as you have seen, I removed them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Samaria did not commit half your sins! You have
done more abominable things than they, and have even made your sisters appear
just, with all the abominable deeds you have done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>52
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>You, then, bear your shame; you are an argument
in favor of your sisters! In view of your sinful deeds, more abominable than
theirs, they appear just in comparison with you. Blush for shame, and bear the
shame of having made your sisters appear just. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>53
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>I will restore their fortunes, the fortune of
Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters (and I will restore
your fortune along with them), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>54
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that you may bear your shame and be disgraced
for all the comfort you brought them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>55
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yes, your sisters, Sodom and her daughters,
Samaria and her daughters, shall return to their former state (you and your
daughters shall return to your former state). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>56
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Was not your sister Sodom kept in bad repute by
you while you felt proud of yourself, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>57
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>before your wickedness became evident? Now you
are like her, reproached by the Edomites and all your neighbors, despised on
all sides by the Philistines. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>58
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The penalty of your lewdness and your abominations
- you must bear it all, says the LORD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>59
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For thus speaks the Lord GOD: I will deal with
you according to what you have done, you who despised your oath, breaking a
covenant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Yet I will remember the covenant I made with
you when you were a girl, and I will set up an everlasting covenant with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>61
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then you shall remember your conduct and be
ashamed when I take your sisters, those older and younger than you, and give
them to you as daughters, even though I am not bound by my covenant with you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>62
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For I will re-establish my covenant with you,
that you may know that I am the LORD, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>63
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>that you may remember and be covered with
confusion, and that you may be utterly silenced for shame when I pardon you for
all you have done, says the Lord GOD. </p>
