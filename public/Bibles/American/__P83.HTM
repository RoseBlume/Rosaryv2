<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Joab, son of Zeruiah, observed how the
king felt toward Absalom, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>he sent to Tekoa and brought from there a
gifted woman, to whom he said: &quot;Pretend to be in mourning. Put on mourning
apparel and do not anoint yourself with oil, that you may appear to be a woman
who has been long in mourning for a departed one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then go to the king and speak to him in this
manner.&quot; And Joab instructed her what to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the woman of Tekoa went to the king and fell
prostrate to the ground in homage, saying, &quot;Help, your majesty!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king said to her, &quot;What do you
want?&quot; She replied: &quot;Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your servant had two sons, who quarreled in the
field. There being no one to part them, one of them struck his brother and
killed him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QW href="__P83.HTM#$QW">1</a></sup></font></sup> Then the whole clan confronted your servant
and demanded: 'Give up the one who killed his brother. We must put him to death
for the life of his brother whom he has slain; we must extinguish the heir
also.' Thus they will quench my remaining hope and leave my husband neither
name nor posterity upon the earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king then said to the woman: &quot;Go home.
I will issue a command on your behalf.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The woman of Tekoa answered him, &quot;Let me
and my family be to blame, my lord king; you and your throne are
innocent.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said, &quot;If anyone says a word
to you, have him brought to me, and he shall not touch you again.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But she went on to say, &quot;Please, your
majesty, keep in mind the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood may not go
too far in destruction and that my son may not be done away with.&quot; He
replied, &quot;As the LORD lives, not a hair of your son shall fall to the
ground.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The woman continued, &quot;Please let your
servant say still another word to my lord the king.&quot; He replied,
&quot;Speak.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the woman said: &quot;Why, then, do you
think of this same kind of thing against the people of God? In pronouncing as
he has, the king shows himself guilty, for not bringing back his own banished
son. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QX href="__P83.HTM#$QX">2</a></sup></font></sup> We must indeed die; we are then like water
that is poured out on the ground and cannot be gathered up. Yet, though God
does not bring back life, he does take thought how not to banish anyone from
him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>And now, if I have presumed to speak of this
matter to your majesty, it is because the people have given me cause to fear.
And so your servant thought: 'Let me speak to the king. Perhaps he will grant
the petition of his maidservant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>For the king must surely consent to free his
servant from the grasp of one who would seek to destroy me and my son as well
from God's inheritance.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-QY href="__P83.HTM#$QY">3</a></sup></font></sup> And the woman concluded: &quot;Let the word of
my lord the king provide a resting place; indeed, my lord the king is like an
angel of God, evaluating good and bad. The LORD your God be with you.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king answered the woman, &quot;Now do not
conceal from me anything I may ask you!&quot; The woman said, &quot;Let my lord
the king speak.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>So the king asked, &quot;Is Joab involved with
you in all this?&quot; And the woman answered: &quot;As you live, my lord the
king, it is just as your majesty has said, and not otherwise. It was your
servant Joab who instructed me and told your servant all these things she was
to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Your servant Joab did this to come at the issue
in a roundabout way. But my lord is as wise as an angel of God, so that he
knows all things on earth.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then the king said to Joab: &quot;I hereby
grant this request. Go, therefore, and bring back young Absalom.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Falling prostrate to the ground in homage and
blessing the king, Joab said, &quot;This day I know that I am in good favor
with you, my lord the king, since the king has granted the request of his
servant.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab then went off to Geshur and brought
Absalom to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>But the king said, &quot;Let him go to his own
house; he shall not appear before me.&quot; So Absalom went off to his house
and did not appear before the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>In all Israel there was not a man who could so
be praised for his beauty as Absalom, who was without blemish from the sole of
his foot to the crown of his head. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When he shaved his head - which he used to do
at the end of every year, because his hair became too heavy for him - the hair
weighed two hundred shekels according to the royal standard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom had three sons born to him, besides a
daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years
without appearing before the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Then he summoned Joab to send him to the king,
but Joab would not come to him. Although he summoned him a second time, Joab
refused to come. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He therefore instructed his servants: &quot;You
see Joab's field that borders mine, on which he has barley. Go, set it on
fire.&quot; And so Absalom's servants set the field on fire. Joab's farmhands
came to him with torn garments and reported to him what had been done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>At this, Joab went to Absalom in his house and
asked him, &quot;Why have your servants set my field on fire?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Absalom answered Joab: &quot;I was summoning
you to come here, that I may send you to the king to say: 'Why did I come back
from Geshur? I would be better off if I were still there!' Now, let me appear
before the king. If I am guilty, let him put me to death.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Joab went to the king and reported this. The
king then called Absalom, who came to him and in homage fell on his face to the
ground before the king. Then the king kissed him. </p>
