<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><i>Chapter 7</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His own palace Solomon completed after thirteen
years of construction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He built the hall called the Forest of Lebanon one
hundred cubits long, fifty wide, and thirty high; it was supported by four rows
of cedar columns, with cedar capitals upon the columns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Moreover, it had a ceiling of cedar above the
beams resting on the columns; these beams numbered forty-five, fifteen to a
row. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were three window frames at either end,
with windows in strict alignment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The posts of all the doorways were rectangular,
and the doorways faced each other, three at either end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The porch of the columned hall he made fifty
cubits long and thirty wide. The porch extended the width of the columned hall,
and there was a canopy in front. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He also built the vestibule of the throne where
he gave judgment - that is, the tribunal; it was paneled with cedar from floor
to ceiling beams. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>His living quarters were in another court, set
in deeper than the tribunal and of the same construction. A palace like this
tribunal was built for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had married. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>All these buildings were of fine stones, hewn
to size and trimmed front and back with a saw, from the foundation to the
bonding course. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>(The foundation was made of fine, large blocks,
some ten cubits and some eight cubits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Above were fine stones hewn to size, and cedar
wood.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The great court was enclosed by three courses
of hewn stones and a bonding course of cedar beams. So also were the inner
court of the temple of the LORD and the temple porch. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>King Solomon had Hiram brought from Tyre. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>He was a bronze worker, the son of a widow from
the tribe of Naphtali; his father had been from Tyre. He was endowed with
skill, understanding, and knowledge of how to produce any work in bronze. He
came to King Solomon and did all his metal work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RT href="__P8L.HTM#$RT">1</a></sup></font></sup> Two hollow bronze columns were cast, each
eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference; their metal was of
four fingers' thickness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>There were also two capitals cast in bronze, to
place on top of the columns, each of them five cubits high. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Two pieces of network with a chainlike mesh
were made to cover the (nodes of the) capitals on top of the columns, one for
each capital. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Four hundred pomegranates were also cast; two
hundred of them in a double row encircled the piece of network on each of the
two capitals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The capitals on top of the columns were
finished wholly in a lotus pattern </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>above the level of the nodes and their
enveloping network. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The columns were then erected adjacent to the
porch of the temple, one to the right, called Jachin, and the other to the
left, called Boaz. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Thus the work on the columns was completed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><sup><font face=Verdana size=2><sup><a name=-RU href="__P8L.HTM#$RU">2</a></sup></font></sup> The sea was then cast; it was made with a
circular rim, and measured ten cubits across, five in height, and thirty in
circumference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Under the brim, gourds encircled it, ten to the
cubit all the way around; the gourds were in two rows and were cast in one mold
with the sea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This rested on twelve oxen, three facing north,
three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east, with their
haunches all toward the center, where the sea was set upon them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim
resembled that of a cup, being lily-shaped. Its capacity was two thousand
measures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ten stands were also made of bronze, each four
cubits long, four wide, and three high. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When these stands were constructed, panels were
set within the framework. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the panels between the frames there were
lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the frames likewise, above and below the
lions and oxen, there were wreaths in relief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Each stand had four bronze wheels and bronze
axles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This was surmounted by a crown one cubit high
within which was a rounded opening to provide a receptacle a cubit and a half
in depth. There was carved work at the opening, on panels that were angular,
not curved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The four wheels were below the paneling, and
the axletrees of the wheels and the stand were of one piece. Each wheel was a
cubit and a half high. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The wheels were constructed like chariot
wheels; their axles, fellies, spokes, and hubs were all cast. The four legs of
each stand had cast braces, which were under the basin; they had wreaths on
each side. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>These four braces, extending to the corners of
each stand, were of one piece with the stand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On top of the stand there was a raised collar
half a cubit high, with supports and panels which were of one piece with the
top of the stand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>36
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>On the surfaces of the supports and on the
panels, wherever there was a clear space, cherubim, lions, and palm trees were
carved, as well as wreaths all around. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>37
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>This was how the ten stands were made, all of
the same casting, the same size, the same shape. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>38
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Ten bronze basins were then made, each four
cubits in diameter with a capacity of forty measures, one basin for the top of
each of the ten stands. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>39
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The stands were placed, five on the south side
of the temple and five on the north. The sea was placed off to the southeast
from the south side of the temple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When Hiram made the pots, shovels, and bowls,
he therewith completed all his work for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD:
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>41
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>two columns, two nodes for the capitals on top
of the columns, two pieces of network covering the nodes for the capitals on
top of the columns, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>42
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>four hundred pomegranates in double rows on both
pieces of network that covered the two nodes of the capitals where they met the
columns, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>43
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>ten stands, ten basins on the stands, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>44
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>one sea, twelve oxen supporting the sea, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>45
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>pots, shovels, and bowls. All these articles
which Hiram made for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD were of burnished
bronze. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>46
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>The king had them cast in the neighborhood of
the Jordan, in the clayey ground between Succoth and Zarethan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>47
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon did not weigh all the articles because
they were so numerous; the weight of the bronze, therefore, was not determined.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>48
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Solomon had all the articles made for the
interior of the temple of the LORD: the golden altar; the golden table on which
the showbread lay; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>the lampstands of pure gold, five to the right
and five to the left before the sanctuary, with their flowers, lamps, and tongs
of gold; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>basins, snuffers, bowls, cups, and fire pans of
pure gold; and hinges of gold for the doors of the inner room, or holy of
holies, and for the doors of the outer room, the nave. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>51
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>When all the work undertaken by King Solomon in
the temple of the LORD was completed, he brought in the dedicated offerings of
his father David, putting the silver, gold, and other articles in the
treasuries of the temple of the LORD. </p>
